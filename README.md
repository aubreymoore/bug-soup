## Note to ALBI-345 Students

This repository contains images of sticky traps used by some of my students in my General Entomology class (ALBI-345, Fanuchanan 2021).

The entire repository can be downloaded as a zip file by cicking on the **code button** at the top of the [main page](https://github.com/aubreymoore/bug-soup). The download takes about 2 minutes on my machine and the zip file is about 540 MB. When you have unzipped the file, you will find your images in the **output** directory (folder).
