Its limitations are discussed from different perspectives: nomenclature, general pragmatism, and problems of DNA-based species delimitation in the light of the central aim of achieving a robust and stable nomenclature of organisms, essential for all applications of biodiversity research. This issue needs to be addressed to prevent restraining the progress of taxonomy and its ability to contribute to modern science.},

  abstract = {Biohybrid systems integrate living materials with synthetic devices, exploiting their respective advantages to solve challenging engineering problems. One challenge of critical importance to society is detecting and localizing airborne volatile chemicals. Many flying animals depend their ability to detect and locate the source of aerial chemical plumes for finding mates and food sources. A robot with comparable capability could reduce human hazard and drastically improve performance on tasks such as locating disaster survivors, hazardous gas leaks, incipient fires, or explosives. Three advances are needed before they can rival their biological counterparts: (1) a chemical sensor with a much faster response time that nevertheless satisfies the size, weight, and power constraints of flight, (2) a design, sensor suite, and control system that allows it to move toward the source of a plume fully autonomously while navigating obstacles, and (3) the ability to detect the plume with high specificity and sensitivity among the assortment of chemicals that invariably exist in the air. Here we address the first two, introducing a human-safe palm-sized air vehicle equipped with the odor-sensing antenna of an insect, the first odor-sensing biohybrid robot system to fly. Using this sensor along with a suite of additional navigational sensors, as well as passive wind fins, our robot orients upwind and navigates autonomously toward the source of airborne plumes. Our robot is the first flying biohybrid system to successfully perform odor localization in a confined space, and it is able to do so while detecting and avoiding obstacles in its flight path. We show that insect antennae respond more quickly than metal oxide gas sensors, enabling odor localization at an improved speed over previous flying robots. By using the insect antennae, we anticipate a feasible path toward improved chemical specificity and sensitivity by leveraging recent advances in gene editing.},

Results demonstrate that the direct use of the projection generated inside the mobile phone or with Gear 360 Action Direction (the desktop software for post-processing) have a relatively low metric accuracy. As results were in contrast with the accuracy achieved by using the original fisheye images (front and rear facing images) in photogrammetric reconstructions, an alternative solution to generate the equirectangular projections was developed. A calibration aimed at understanding the intrinsic parameters of the two lenses camera, as well as their relative orientation, allowed one to generate new equirectangular projections from which a significant improvement of geometric accuracy has been achieved.},

In Malaysia, in addition to well-known breeding sites it is able to multiply in shredded chipped old oil palm trunk material in replant areas, also in empty fruit bunches. The aggregation pheromone ethyl 4-methyloctanoate is produced by males of O. rhinoceros (also by the similar pest O. monoceros in Africa), and is used in traps as an important component of Integrated Pest Management (IPM) and in ecological studies. In Malaysia, the incidence of endemic entomopathogens can be increased. The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae is available for use as a biopesticide against immature stages in breeding sites and may be distributed by adults. The molecular and ultrastructure of Oryctes Nudivirus (OrNV) has been extensively studied. It kills larvae and is disseminated by adults. New PCR techniques may enable reliable estimates of the quantity of virions in experimental dosages ingested and hence of the virulence of different isolates. It is possible one isolate when released may out compete another.\textbackslash n},

The fungus Metarhizium anisopliae has potential as a biopesticide against immature stages in friable breeding sites. The molecular biology and ultrastructure of Oryctes rhinoceros Nudivirus (OrNV), disseminated by adults, have been studied, and this pathogen can reduce O. rhinoceros populations and damage when introduced into new locations, especially where damage had been high. New PCR techniques may enable reliable quantification of dosages ingested and hence virulence of different isolates. Male-produced aggregation pheromones have been identified in several species, for which they may have management potential, having been used commercially for trapping O. rhinoceros in oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, and tested against O. monoceros in Africa.},

  abstract = {Insect monitoring methods are typically very time-consuming and involve substantial investment in species identification following manual trapping in the field. Insect traps are often only serviced weekly, resulting in low temporal resolution of the monitoring data, which hampers the ecological interpretation. This paper presents a portable computer vision system capable of attracting and detecting live insects. More specifically, the paper proposes detection and classification of species by recording images of live individuals attracted to a light trap. An Automated Moth Trap (AMT) with multiple light sources and a camera was designed to attract and monitor live insects during twilight and night hours. A computer vision algorithm referred to as Moth Classification and Counting (MCC), based on deep learning analysis of the captured images, tracked and counted the number of insects and identified moth species. Observations over 48 nights resulted in the capture of more than 250,000 images with an average of 5675 images per night. A customized convolutional neural network was trained on 2000 labeled images of live moths represented by eight different classes, achieving a high validation F1-score of 0.93. The algorithm measured an average classification and tracking F1-score of 0.71 and a tracking detection rate of 0.79. Overall, the proposed computer vision system and algorithm showed promising results as a low-cost solution for non-destructive and automatic monitoring of moths.},

Guam in particular among the Insular Pacific islands has been especially hard hit by invasive species due to its centuries-long history as a transportation hub and strategic military location.  Health of the overall coconut palm population in Guam is declining more rapidly in recent years since Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected in 2007 in Tumon.  Tinangaja, a slow-acting, lethal disease caused by the Coconut tinangaja viroid, was previously known only in Guam.  Prior to the introduction of CRB, Tinangaja disease was reported to affect 30\% of the coconut palm population.  Anecdotal reports of the disease in Rota and Tinian have emerged and visual diagnosis confirmed by the authors.  Results of currently on-going surveys for Tinangaja in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands will be presented.  Additionally, the potential impact of CRB expansion on Tinangaja disease incidence will be presented with an overview of CRB management and biocontrol programs in Guam.},

Low-cost, time-saving and easy-to-operate tools for automated monitoring will therefore play a key role in increased acceptance and application of IPM in practice. In this study, we tested the differentiation of two whitefly species and their natural enemies trapped on yellow sticky traps (YSTs) via image processing approaches under practical conditions. Using the bag of visual words (BoVW) algorithm, accurate differentiation between both natural enemies and the Trialeurodes vaporariorum and Bemisia tabaci species was possible, whereas the procedure for B. tabaci could not be used to differentiate this species from T. vaporariorum. The decay of species was considered using fresh and aged catches of all the species on the YSTs, and different pooling scenarios were applied to enhance model performance. The best performance was reached when fresh and aged individuals were used together and the whitefly species were pooled into one category for model training. With an independent dataset consisting of photos from the YSTs that were placed in greenhouses and consequently with a naturally occurring species mixture as the background, a differentiation rate of more than 85\% was reached for natural enemies and whiteflies.},

  abstract = {The night-time environment is increasingly being lit, often by broad-spectrum lighting, and there is growing evidence that artificial light at night (ALAN) has consequences for ecosystems, potentially contributing to declines in insect populations. Moths are species-rich, sensitive to ALAN, and have undergone declines in Europe, making them the ideal group for investigating the impacts of light pollution on nocturnal insects more broadly. Here, we take a life cycle approach to review the impacts of ALAN on moths, drawing on a range of disciplines including ecology, physiology, and applied entomology. We find evidence of diverse impacts across most life stages and key behaviours. Many studies have examined flight-to-light behaviour in adults and our meta-analysis found that mercury vapour, metal halide, and compact fluorescent bulbs induce this more than LED and sodium lamps. However, we found that ALAN can also disrupt reproduction, larval development, and pupal diapause, with likely negative impacts on individual fitness, and that moths can be indirectly affected via hostplants and predators. These findings indicate that ALAN could also affect day-flying insects through impacts on earlier life stages. Overall, we found strong evidence for effects of artificial light on moth behaviour and physiology, but little rigorous, direct evidence that this scales up to impacts on populations. Crucially, there is a need to determine the potential contribution of ALAN to insect declines, relative to other drivers of change. In the meantime, we recommend precautionary strategies to mitigate possible negative effects of ALAN on insect populations.},

  abstract = {During last decade we have developed and applied optical remote sensing instrumentation for in situ remote surveillance and quantification of the aerofauna. The sparse structure of aerofauna makes optical focusing challenging, but we solved this issue through applying the century old Scheimpflug condition. With this approach we have managed to reduce size, cost and complexity of atmospheric lidars and accomplished an effective tool for ecological entomology capable of counting thousands of insects per hour. Because of the high sensitivity and resolution in time and space, we can retrieve target modulation signatures in the kHz range for target classification purposes. As opposed to the cm waves in entomological radar, we rely on near infrared light around one micron. This allow superior beam quality, negligible ground clutter and applications close over ground or within vegetation structure. Near infrared light can assess both molecular and microstructural properties of the target through differential absorption and depolarization. Here we give the background of entomological lidar, summarize our recent progress and put it in context with contemporary work. We outline applications, ongoing activities and state of the art. We discuss future prospects and challenges.},

Lack of real-time observational tools for continuously assessing the unperturbed mosquito flight activity in situ limits progress toward improved vector control. We deployed a high-resolution entomological lidar to monitor a half-kilometer static transect adjacent to a Tanzanian village. We evaluated one-third million insect observations during five nights, four days, and one annular solar eclipse. We demonstrate in situ lidar classification of several insect families and their sexes based on their modulation signatures. We were able to compare the fine-scale spatiotemporal activity patterns of malaria vectors during ordinary days and an eclipse to disentangle phototactic activity patterns from the circadian mechanism. We observed an increased insect activity during the eclipse attributable to mosquitoes. These unprecedented findings demonstrate how lidar-based monitoring of distinct mosquito activities could advance our understanding of vector ecology. Free flying mosquitoes in the Tanzanian countryside confused by eclipse were classified by novel laser radar surveillance.

  abstract = {SummaryThe avifauna of the Mariana Islands, an archipelago in the western Pacific, faces the threats of rapid economic development and the spread of non-native species, particularly a devastating predator, Brown Tree Snake Boiga irregularis. In this paper, we examine the status and trends of the land bird fauna of Saipan Island based on three island-wide surveys conducted in 1982, 1997, and 2007. During this period, the human population on Saipan increased more than four-fold and much of the island has been developed. The surveys employed standard point-transect methods based on Distance Sampling. Remarkably, we found nearly all species of land birds - 11 native species and three introduced species - to be common or abundant. The exception was the Micronesian Megapode Megapodius laperouse, a historically rare species that was not observed on the 2007 survey, although it does persist on Saipan and other Mariana islands. A comparison of species densities among the three surveys showed that seven species, mainly fruit and seed-eaters, had increased and three species of insectivorous birds had decreased - Rufous Fantail Rhipidura rufifrons, Nightingale Reed-warbler Acrocephalus luscinia, and Golden White-eye Cleptornis marchei. Of these three, Nightingale Reed-warbler is listed as ‘Endangered’ on the IUCN Red List and as an Endangered Species by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Reed-warbler densities on Saipan decreased by more than half between 1982 and 2007. Although point transect sampling worked well for this species, density estimates and trends assessment could be improved by reallocating sampling stations among habitats and by more frequent sampling.},

  abstract = {Introduced mammals are major drivers of extinction. Feral goats (Capra hircus) are particularly devastating to island ecosystems, causing direct and indirect impacts through overgrazing, which often results in ecosystem degradation and biodiversity loss. Removing goat populations from islands is a powerful conservation tool to prevent extinctions and restore ecosystems. Goats have been eradicated successfully from 120 islands worldwide.With newly developed technology and techniques, island size is perhaps no longer a limiting factor in the successful removal of introduced goat populations. Furthermore, the use of global positioning systems, geographic information systems, aerial hunting by helicopter, specialized hunting dogs, and Judas goats has dramatically increased efficiency and significantly reduced the duration of eradication campaigns. Intensive monitoring programs are also critical for successful eradications. Because of the presence of humans with domestic goat populations on large islands, future island conservation actions will require eradication programs that involve local island inhabitants in a collaborative approach with biologists, sociologists, and educators. Given the clear biodiversity benefits, introduced goat populations should be routinely removed from islands.},

  abstract = {The flight patterns of bees have been studied for over 100 years, but due to their small size, bees can only be tracked by eye for a very short distance from the nest or hive. Scientists have employed various techniques, including mark-recapture5, feeder experiments26, homing experiments23 and the interpretation of bee dances25, to investigate bee foraging ranges. There is, however, still little detailed information about flight patterns between nest and forage sites, or about the behaviour involved in learning the features of the landscape. The adaptation of radar techniques for use in entomological research, has allowed insect flight paths to be accurately and continuously tracked over much greater distances. This article summarizes the progress made in applying radar to bee studies, and suggests some possibilities for the future.},

Since then, we have confirmed that lobate lac scale infests over 110 plant species in Hawaii, mainly ornamental and landscape plants in urban areas. The major impacts on host plants are dieback of twigs and branches, thinning of foliage, and death of the entire plant in some species. Given the frequency of interisland transportation of goods and people, it is likely that lobate lac scale spread to neighbor islands since its discovery on Oahu. We started this survey in January 2016 covering all major neighbor islands in Hawaii: Hawaii, Maui, Kauai, Molokai, and Lanai. Lobate lac scale was detected in Kona in May 2016, the first confirmed incidence of this pest on a neighbor island outside of Oahu. Lobate lac scale was detected in Lihue in January 2017, the first confirmed incidence of this pest on Kauai. With contribution from Hawaii Department of Agriculture, lobate lac scale was detected on Maui in May 2016. No lobate lac scale was detected on Molokai and Lanai in our survey. Inter-island shipping of nursery plants was considered the key route for the spread of lobate lac scale from Oahu to neighbor islands.},

Three of the eight species (Rana guentheri, Polypedates megacephalus, and Eleutherodactylus planirostris) had well-established breeding populations by 2005. A further three (Fejervarya cf. limnocharis, Fejervarya cancrivora, and Microhyla pulchra) were recorded from a number of individuals, but it is not known whether these species have established breeding populations. Two species (Kaloula pulchra and Eleutherodactylus coqui) appear to be incidental transportations to the island that have not established. Before 2003, five anuran species, all introductions, had been recorded from Guam. Three of these, Polypedates leucomystax, Pseudacris regilla, and Kaloula picta, were detected on Guam in incoming cargo but destroyed. Two species established: Bufo marinus was deliberately introduced and the Australian hylid Litoria fallax was probably an accidental introduction. Successful establishment of anurans on Guam has increased the risk of frog introductions to nearby islands. By providing additional food sources for the brown tree snake (Boiga irregularis), anuran introductions have increased the chance that B. irregularis might substantially increase in numbers and in turn increase the risk of the snake being accidentally transported to other islands.},

The goal of our study was to investigate the presence of Rickettsia species on the island of Guam by testing ticks found on Philippine deer (Rusa marianna) and wild pigs (Sus scrofa). Increasing numbers of these species have led to increased interactions with humans, including hunting, highlighting the importance of studies on vector prevalence and associated zoonotic pathogens. In this study, ticks were removed from Philippine deer and wild pigs in March and April of 2015 and tested for Rickettsia spp. using nested PCR. Overall, a low prevalence of Rickettsia spp. was detected (5.4\% (6/112 ticks)). Ticks removed from wild pigs were identified as Amblyomma breviscutatum, one of which was positive for Rickettsia ambylommatis. Ticks recovered from Philippine deer were identified as Rhipicephalus microplus, and five were positive for Rickettsia; two with R. amblyommatis and one with ‘Candidatus Rickettsia senegalensis’, a recently proposed species in the R. felis cluster. The remaining two sequences were short and species classification was not possible. Rickettsia felis is a known zoonotic pathogen in the spotted fever group of Rickettsia and there is evidence that ‘C. R. senegalensis’ can also cause illness in people. This study confirms the occurrence of Rickettsia in ticks on Guam and highlights the presence of potential human pathogenic species in the R. felis cluster.},

The Bonin Islands and Kiribati are poorly sampled, and our understanding of the ant fauna in the whole of Micronesia could benefit greatly from additional collections. Many new and interesting species are known from single collections or single specimens, even on Pohnpei, which is perhaps now the most thoroughly sampled large island in the region. The Marshall Islands contain mostly pan-Pacific and pantropical tramp species, but there do exist collections from the Marshalls (such as a series of Pheidole minors) that can only be clarified through further fieldwork.

The transfer vector, a pUC8-based plasmid, contained the polyhedrin gene from the Autographa californica nuclear polyhedrosis virus, flanked by Oryctes baculovirus DNA from the HindIII fragment N. Oryctes baculovirus does not form plaques with DSIR-HA-1179 cells. Therefore an endpoint dilution method was used to screen for, recover and purify recombinants. There was no phenotypic character that could be used for detecting recombinants, so a dot blot assay was used to screen infected cultures for the presence of recombinants. A recombinant generated by this method contained the entire polyhedrin gene inserted at 98.03 map units from the designated start of the Oryctes baculovirus physical map. No evidence of transcription or translation of the polyhedrin gene was obtained.},

Two decades ago, the ''100 of the world's worst'' invasive alien species list was established by the IUCN to improve communications , identifying particularly damaging 'flagship' invaders globally (hereafter, worst). Whilst this list has bolstered invader awareness , whether worst species are especially economically damaging and how they compare to other invaders (hereafter, other) remain unknown. Here, we quantify invasion costs using the most comprehensive global database compiling them (InvaCost). We compare these costs between worst and other species against sectorial, taxonomic and regional descriptors, and examine temporal cost trends. Only 60 of the 100 worst species had invasion costs considered as highly reliable and actually observed estimates (median: US\$ 43 million). On average, these costs were significantly higher than the 463 other invasive species recorded in InvaCost (median: US\$ 0.53 million), although some other species had higher costs than most worst species. Damages to the environment from the worst species dominated, whereas other species largely impacted agriculture. Disproportionately highest worst species costs were incurred in North America, whilst costs were more evenly distributed for other species; animal invasions were always costliest. Proportional management expenditures were low for the other species, and surprisingly, over twice as low for the worst species.},

  abstract = {Several studies report a substantial decline in insect populations. Most commonly, the declines involve reductions in abundance, though in some cases entire species are going extinct. The declines are far from uniform. In some localities, there have been reports of increases in overall insect population, and some types of insects appear to be increasing in abundance across the world. Some of the insects most affected include bees, butterflies, moths, beetles, dragonflies and damselflies. Anecdotal evidence has been offered of much greater apparent abundance of insects in the 20th century; recollections of the windscreen phenomenon are an example.Possible causes are similar to other biodiversity loss, with studies identifying: habitat destruction, including intensive agriculture; the use of pesticides (particularly insecticides); urbanization, and industrialization; introduced species; and climate change. Not all insect orders are affected in the same way; many groups are the subject of limited research, and comparative figures from earlier decades are often not available. In response to the reported declines, increased insect related conservation measures have been launched. In 2018 the German government initiated an "Action Programme for Insect Protection", and in 2019 a group of 27 British entomologists and ecologists wrote an open letter calling on the research establishment in the UK "to enable intensive investigation of the real threat of ecological disruption caused by insect declines without delay".},

  abstract = {Scale-infested cycad leaves were sampled on the island of Guam in a wide range of habitats in 2017 and 2018 to determine the extent of parasitoid control of the scale. The sampling unit was a leaflet selected from five trees per habitat during each sampling date. The number of scales were counted with a hand lens and parasitoids were reared in a growth chamber at 60\% relative humidity. Infested leaflets were transferred to new rearing vessels after 48 hour intervals and returned to the growth chamber. Insects were rinsed with 70\% EtOH and parasitoids were counted with the aid of a microscope. The abaxial leaflet surfaces harbored greater numbers of scale than the adaxial surfaces. In a Northern Guam site where parasitoids were first fortuitously discovered in 2013, only 20\% of the samples yielded parasitoids. For each geographic site, the presence of parasitoids on one sampling date did not always lead to evidence of parasitoids at a later sampling date. The number of parasitized scales was minimal despite the widespread geographic occurrence of the parasitoids. Several native and exotic Cycas cycad species were historically heavily used in the commercial and residential landscapes of Guam, and the recent invasion of the cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS) Aulacaspis yasumatsui Takagi has devastated these cycad populations. These results provide the first evidence that scale parasitoids are established throughout most of the island, but they are not effectively controlling the scale infestations. This case study is an example of how the horticulture profession can aid in responding to an ecological disaster.},

  abstract = {During the last four years the Oryctes rhinoceros aggregation pheromone has been experimented, packed in different kind of dispensers and used or large scale in the oil palm plantations in Sumatra under a research programme at Marihat with the Indonesian Oil Palm Research Institute. For improving the use of this method and its bioefficacy in the control of the beetles new pherotraps have been designed and tested. Different models are now available in order to increase the trapping capacity of the traps and to reduce the cost, Pitfalltrap pail or pipe model, Parabola system, Vane trap modified model, Superparabola. The performance of these pherotraps with their advantages and disadvantages are presented. The parabola system using empty mineral bootie fixed to a parabolic dish is the cheapiest model and is very easy to put in place in the field, only attached to a pole. The Vane Trap modified and the Superparabola systems, more sophisticated, are highly effective in terms of capture, but due to the cheap cost of the second one, the Superparabola is more advisable. However for collecting the adults well alive in order to be used again for infection with pathogens, the Pitfalltrap models are more practical. With the pheromone the use of additional rotten empty bunches placed in the traps that has a synergetic effect increases the importance of the catches until four times more than with the conventional systems. But to avoid the dessication of the empty bunches it needs to use the equivalent of two to three bunches per trap. Therefore for pitfalltraps it needs pail or pipe of ten gallons capacity. Regarding the material used lasting longer the cost is even cheaper and the results obtained far better. In term of strategies, utilization of pherotraps in replantation on a large scale covering completely a year of planting, instead of individual blocks more heavily affected and recontaminated, gives the possibility to maintain the Oryctes population under critical level. On mature palms also frequently attacked and even destroyed, pherotraps used as a barrier along the blocks with dispensers collected each morning and replaced in the traps in the afternoon, saving half of the product, is the best way to protect the palms. The same strategy is used for reduction of the beetles population in old plantations before replanting. Therefore in function of the needs, importance of the Oryctes population, year of planting affected, decrease of the inoculum before replanting, necessity of keeping alive the adults for infection and release, association of empty bunches with pheromone, cost of the traps, a choice between these different models of pherotraps can be made by the planters along with the strategies to use in order to increase the bioefficacy of the pheromone for a perfect biocontrol of the rhinoceros beetles.

The InvaCost database has enabled the generation of a reliable, comprehensive, standardized and easily updatable synthesis of the monetary costs of biological invasions worldwide3. Here we found that the total reported costs of invasions reached a minimum of US\$1.288 trillion (2017 US dollars) over the past few decades (1970–2017), with an annual mean cost of US\$26.8 billion. Moreover, we estimate that the annual mean cost could reach US\$162.7 billion in 2017. These costs remain strongly underestimated and do not show any sign of slowing down, exhibiting a consistent threefold increase per decade. We show that the documented costs are widely distributed and have strong gaps at regional and taxonomic scales, with damage costs being an order of magnitude higher than management expenditures. Research approaches that document the costs of biological invasions need to be further improved. Nonetheless, our findings call for the implementation of consistent management actions and international policy agreements that aim to reduce the burden of invasive alien species. Analysis of the InvaCost database shows that the costs of biological invasions have markedly increased between 1970 and 2017 and show no sign of slowing down, highlighting the importance of evidence-based and cost-effective management actions.},

  abstract = {Light sensing by tissues distinct from the eye occurs in diverse animal groups, enabling circadian control and phototactic behaviour. Extraocular photoreceptors may also facilitate rapid colour change in cephalopods and lizards, but little is known about the sensory system that mediates slow colour change in arthropods. We previously reported that slow colour change in twig-mimicking caterpillars of the peppered moth (Biston betularia) is a response to achromatic and chromatic visual cues. Here we show that the perception of these cues, and the resulting phenotypic responses, does not require ocular vision. Caterpillars with completely obscured ocelli remained capable of enhancing their crypsis by changing colour and choosing to rest on colour-matching twigs. A suite of visual genes, expressed across the larval integument, likely plays a key role in the mechanism. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that extraocular colour sensing can mediate pigment-based colour change and behaviour in an arthropod.},

This information is required by federal regulations to properly determine the potential impacts that will occur due to the shifting of significant military resources from Okinawa to the Territory of Guam and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. As part of this military build-up, Pagan is under consideration as a live fire training area. This report gives the results of a terrestrial arthropod survey conducted by USFWS and NAVPAC personnel on Pagan in the month of July 2010 and gives details on significant findings resulting from material collected on that survey. In addition, a full checklist of terrestrial arthropods known from Pagan Island is given based on the current survey material as well as previous published records....},

  abstract = {Despite islands contributing only 6.7\% of land surface area, they harbor \textasciitilde 20\% of the Earth’s biodiversity, but unfortunately also \textasciitilde 50\% of the threatened species and 75\% of the known extinctions since the European expansion around the globe. Due to their geological and geographic history and characteristics, islands act simultaneously as cradles of evolutionary diversity and museums of formerly widespread lineages—elements that permit islands to achieve an outstanding endemicity. Nevertheless, the majority of these endemic species are inherently vulnerable due to genetic and demographic factors linked with the way islands are colonized. Here, we stress the great variation of islands in their physical geography (area, isolation, altitude, latitude) and history (age, human colonization, human density). We provide examples of some of the most species rich and iconic insular radiations. Next, we analyze the natural vulnerability of the insular biota, linked to genetic and demographic factors as a result of founder events as well as the typically small population sizes of many island species. We note that, whereas evolution toward island syndromes (including size shifts, derived insular woodiness, altered dispersal ability, loss of defense traits, reduction in clutch size) might have improved the ability of species to thrive under natural conditions on islands, it has simultaneously made island biota disproportionately vulnerable to anthropogenic pressures such as habitat loss, overexploitation, invasive species, and climate change. This has led to the documented extinction of at least 800 insular species in the past 500 years, in addition to the many that had already gone extinct following the arrival of first human colonists on islands in prehistoric times. Finally, we summarize current scientific knowledge on the ongoing biodiversity loss on islands worldwide and express our serious concern that the current trajectory will continue to decimate the unique and irreplaceable natural heritage of the world’s islands. We conclude that drastic actions are urgently needed to bend the curve of the alarming rates of island biodiversity loss.},

This paper proposed a study on detection Aedes Aegypti larvae in water storage tank by combining transfer learning with Faster-RCNN. The purpose of the study is to acquire train and validation losses along with detection performance metrics. The experimental results disclose that the probability detection has scored 97.01\% while false alarm has scored 5.97\%. Those significant value has depicted that the trained model has high detection accuracies.}

  abstract = {Mosquito-borne diseases are a major challenge for Human health as they affect nearly 700 million people every year and result in over 1 million deaths. Reliable information on the evolution of population and spatial distribution of key insects species is of major importance in the development of eco-epidemiologic models. This paper reports on the remote characterization of flying mosquitoes using a continuous-wave infrared optical remote sensing system. The system is setup in a controlled environment to mimic long-range lidars, mosquitoes are free flying at a distance of \textasciitilde{} 4 m from the collecting optics. The wing beat frequency is retrieved from the backscattered light from mosquitoes transiting through the laser beam. A total of 427 transit signals have been recorded from three mosquito species, males and females. Since the mosquito species and gender are known a priori, we investigate the use of wing beat frequency as the sole predictor variable for two Bayesian classifications: gender alone (two classes) and species/gender (six classes). The gender of each mosquito is retrieved with a 96.5\% accuracy while the species/gender of mosquitoes is retrieved with a 62.3\% accuracy. Known to be an efficient mean to identify insect family, we discuss the limitations of using wing beat frequency alone to identify insect species.},

The chance of a systemic reaction to a sting is low (5–10\%) in large local reactors and in children with mild (cutaneous) systemic reactions, and varies between 25\% and 70\% in adults depending on the severity previous sting reactions. Venom skin tests are most accurate for diagnosis but the RAST is an important complementary test. The degree of sensitivity on skin test or RAST does not reliably predict the severity of a sting reaction. Venom sensitization can be detected in 25\% of adults, so the history is most important. Venom immunotherapy is 75–98\% effective in preventing sting anaphylaxis. Most patients can discontinue treatment after 5 years, with very low residual risk of a severe sting reaction.},

  abstract = {The majority of conservation efforts and public attention are focused on large, charismatic mammals and birds such as tigers, pandas and penguins, yet the bulk of animal life, whether measured by biomass, numerical abundance or numbers of species, consists of invertebrates such as insects. Arguably, these innumerable little creatures are far more important for the functioning of ecosystems than their furry or feathered brethren, but until recently we had few long-term data on their population trends. Recent studies from Germany and Puerto Rico suggest that insects may be in a state of catastrophic population collapse: the German data describe a 76\% decline in biomass over 26 years, while the Puerto Rican study estimates a decline of between 75\% and 98\% over 35 years. Corroborative evidence, for example from butterflies in Europe and California (which both show slightly less dramatic reductions in abundance), suggest that these declines are not isolated. The causes are much debated, but almost certainly include habitat loss, chronic exposure to pesticides, and climate change. The consequences are clear; insects are integral to every terrestrial food web, being food for numerous birds, bats, reptiles, amphibians and fish, and performing vital roles such as pollination, pest control and nutrient recycling. Terrestrial and freshwater ecosystems will collapse without insects. These studies are a warning that we may have failed to appreciate the full scale and pace of environmental degradation caused by human activities in the Anthropocene.},

  abstract = {Compartment models of infectious diseases, such as SEIR, are being used extensively to model the COVID‐19 epidemic. Transitions between compartments are modelled either as instantaneous rates in differential equations, or as transition probabilities in discrete time difference or matrix equations. These models give accurate estimates of the position of equilibrium points, when the rate at which individuals enter each stage is equal to the rate at which they exit from it. However, they do not accurately capture the distribution of times that an individual spends in each compartment, so do not accurately capture the transient dynamics of epidemics. Here we show how matrix models can provide a straightforward route to accurately model stage durations, and thus correctly reproduce epidemic dynamics. We apply this approach to modelling the dynamics of a COVID‐19 epidemic. We show that a SEIR model overestimates epidemic durations and substantially underestimates peak infection rates, by factors of 2 and 3 respectively using published parameter estimates based on the progress of the epidemic in Wuhan.},

To facilitate this, we propose: 1. To adopt a controlled vocabulary for the existing Darwin Core term dwc:establishmentMeans 2. To elevate the pathway term from the Invasive Species Pathways extension to become a new Darwin Core term dwc:pathway maintained as part of the Darwin Core standard 3. To adopt a new Darwin Core term dwc:degreeOfEstablishment with an associated controlled vocabulary These changes to the standard will allow users to clearly state whether an occurrence of a species is native to a location or not, how it got there (pathway), and to what extent the species has become a permanent feature of the location. By improving Darwin Core for capturing and sharing these data, we aim to improve the quality of occurrence and checklist data in general and to increase the number of potential uses of these data.}

  abstract = {On the Caribbean island of St. Eustatius, Coralita (Antigonon leptopus) is an aggressive invasive vine posing major biodiversity conservation concerns. The generation of distribution maps can address these conservation concerns by helping to elucidate the drivers of invasion. We test the use of support vector machines to map the distribution of Coralita on St. Eustatius at high spatial resolution and use this map to identify potential landscape and geomorphological factors associated with Coralita presence. This latter step was performed by comparing the actual distribution of Coralita patches to a random distribution of patches. To train the support vector machine algorithm, we used three vegetation indices and seven texture metrics derived from a 2014 WorldView-2 image. The resulting map shows that Coralita covered 3.18\% of the island in 2014, corresponding to an area of 64 ha. The mapped distribution was highly accurate, with 93.2\% overall accuracy (Coralita class producer's accuracy: 76.4\%, user's accuracy: 86.2\%). Using this classification map, we found that Coralita is not randomly distributed across the landscape, occurring significantly closer to roads and drainage channels, in areas with higher accumulated moisture, and on flatter slopes. Coralita was found more often than expected in grasslands, disturbed forest, and urban areas but was relatively rare in natural forest. These results highlight the ability of high spatial resolution data from sensors such as WorldView-2 to produce accurate invasive species, providing valuable information for predicting current and future spread risks and for early detection and removal plans.

  abstract = {Global declines in insects have sparked wide interest among scientists, politicians, and the general public. Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76\%, and mid-summer decline of 82\% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.},

  abstract = {Most animal species on Earth are insects, and recent reports suggest that their abundance is in drastic decline. Although these reports come from a wide range of insect taxa and regions, the evidence to assess the extent of the phenomenon is sparse. Insect populations are challenging to study, and most monitoring methods are labor intensive and inefficient. Advances in computer vision and deep learning provide potential new solutions to this global challenge. Cameras and other sensors can effectively, continuously, and noninvasively perform entomological observations throughout diurnal and seasonal cycles. The physical appearance of specimens can also be captured by automated imaging in the laboratory. When trained on these data, deep learning models can provide estimates of insect abundance, biomass, and diversity. Further, deep learning models can quantify variation in phenotypic traits, behavior, and interactions. Here, we connect recent developments in deep learning and computer vision to the urgent demand for more cost-efficient monitoring of insects and other invertebrates. We present examples of sensor-based monitoring of insects. We show how deep learning tools can be applied to exceptionally large datasets to derive ecological information and discuss the challenges that lie ahead for the implementation of such solutions in entomology. We identify four focal areas, which will facilitate this transformation: 1) validation of image-based taxonomic identification; 2) generation of sufficient training data; 3) development of public, curated reference databases; and 4) solutions to integrate deep learning and molecular tools.},

  abstract = {In view of the increasing and devastating damage by rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros) to coconut palms in the middle of last century, many efforts were made to find an efficient natural control factor against this pest, which could not be controlled by pesticides. The basic procedures of these monitoring programmes are outlined together with the final detection of a virus disease in oil palm estates in Malaysia in 1963. In extensive laboratory studies, the virus was isolated and identified as the first non-occluded, rod-shaped insect virus, morphologically resembling the baculoviruses. Infection experiments clarified the pathology, histopathology, and virulence of the virus and demonstrated that the virus was extremely virulent to larvae after peroral application. These findings encouraged the first pilot release of virus in 1967 in coconut plantations of Western Samoa where breeding sites were contaminated with virus. Surprisingly, the virus became established in the Samoan rhinoceros beetle populations and spread autonomously throughout the Western Samoan islands. As a consequence, there was a drastic decline of the beetle populations followed by a conspicuous recovery of the badly damaged coconut stands. This unexpected phenomenon could only be explained after it was shown that the adult beetle itself is a very active virus vector and thus was responsible for the efficient autodissemination of the virus. The functioning of the beetle as a 'flying virus factory' is due to the unique cytopathic process developing in the midgut after peroral virus infection. Pathological details of this process are presented. Because of the long-term persistence of the virus in the populations, rhinoceros beetle control is maintained. Incorporation of virus into integrated control measures and successful virus releases in many other countries are recorded. ?? 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Currently, infectious diseases reduce the potential yield by an average of 40\% with many farmers in the developing world experiencing yield losses as high as 100\%. The widespread distribution of smartphones among crop growers around the world with an expected 5 billion smartphones by 2020 offers the potential of turning the smartphone into a valuable tool for diverse communities growing food. One potential application is the development of mobile disease diagnostics through machine learning and crowdsourcing. Here we announce the release of over 50,000 expertly curated images on healthy and infected leaves of crops plants through the existing online platform PlantVillage. We describe both the data and the platform.

Thirty-five percent of images showed palms with medium or high levels of damage. Damage was mapped using GPS tags and Picasa 3 software. Analysis showed that evidence of damage was distributed throughout the island, but medium and high damage occurred principally in zones in the North, South West and South of the island. The survey provided a baseline for the level of damage on Taveuni to identify areas to focus remediation activities and monitor changes to protect emerging coconut industries.}

We first divided the existing papers into geospatial, visual, or audio categories. For each category, we analyzed the machine learning pipeline, from dataset creation to model performance. We conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities for further research. While the reviewed ML methods in mosquito control are promising, we recommend a) increased use of crowdsourced and citizen science data, b) a standardized and open ML pipeline for reproducible results, and c) research that incorporates advances in ML. With these suggestions, ML techniques could lead to effective mosquito control in urban environments.},

  abstract = {Worldwide, farmers use insecticides to prevent crop damage caused by insect pests, while they also rely on insect pollinators to enhance crop yield and other insect as natural enemies of pests. In order to target pesticides to pests only, farmers must know exactly where and when pests and beneficial insects are present in the field. A promising solution to this problem could be optical sensors combined with machine learning. We obtained around 10,000 records of flying insects found in oilseed rape (Brassica napus) crops, using an optical remote sensor and evaluated three different classification methods for the obtained signals, reaching over 80\% accuracy. We demonstrate that it is possible to classify insects in flight, making it possible to optimize the application of insecticides in space and time. This will enable a technological leap in precision agriculture, where focus on prudent and environmentally-sensitive use of pesticides is a top priority.},

  abstract = {Many countries are increasing their research on monitoring technology to identify and systematically manage various domestic changes. In particular, the need for remote monitoring is increasing in response to climatic disasters, such as flooding, storms, and rising tides caused by global warming. We developed a smartphone-based environmental monitoring system that enables remote monitoring in any place and at any time. The overall system is composed of a 24-hour smartphone-based imaging system, a monitoring information management system to receive the monitoring information, and stereo image rectification software that provides lens distortion correction, geometric correction, and stereo matching of the monitoring images. The system was developed using the Samsung Galaxy S with the Android OS, as well as open-source-based software and other hardware. It is easy to install, control remotely, and monitor the status of imaging devices. We assessed the accuracy of the micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS) sensors of the smartphone to evaluate the applicability of our environmental monitoring system. The assessment was conducted via survey, using metric cameras, a global positioning system receiver, a three-dimensional laser scanner and total station, geometric correction, and digital elevation models generated with camera internal elements, external elements, and ground control points. We demonstrated the effectiveness of the system, and showed that the accuracy of the MEMS sensor and camera calibration have a significant effect on image analysis.},

  abstract = {The Korean insect industry is rapidly developing, with the Korean horn beetle Allomyrina dichotoma as one of the most popular insects kept as pets. Korean horn beetles reared in local farms are suffering from Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV). In a nationwide investigation on the early death of young larvae due to this virus, 70 to 77\% mortality was found. It was also confirmed that several larvae collected from some wild horn beetle habitats were infected with the virus. Thus, it was concluded that the virus could be transmitted vertically from an infected adult to the offspring and that the OrNV disease is a very serious threat to the wild horn beetle in Korea. With local farmers expecting that an early detection technique would be helpful for the quick removal of infected larvae, an on-site diagnosis method for the viral disease using loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) assay was thus tested. To avoid the DNA extraction process, the LAMP assay used a 50-fold diluted hemolymph was set for diagnosis standardization and convenient on-site application to infected larvae from local farms. A. dichotoma larvae were assayed for the OrNV infectivity with LAMP primers targeting the OrNV\_gp102 gene. To evaluate the LAMP specificity, two bacterial pathogens, Bacillus thuringiensis and Serratia marcescens, causing disease in A. dichotoma were tested along with OrNV. The positive results were detected only from the OrNV-infected larvae.},

During this time, mean maximum temperatures have risen by 2.0 °C. Using the same study area and methods employed by Lister in the 1970s, we discovered that the dry weight biomass of arthropods captured in sweep samples had declined 4 to 8 times, and 30 to 60 times in sticky traps. Analysis of long-term data on canopy arthropods and walking sticks taken as part of the Luquillo Long-Term Ecological Research program revealed sustained declines in abundance over two decades, as well as negative regressions of abundance on mean maximum temperatures. We also document parallel decreases in Luquillo’s insectivorous lizards, frogs, and birds.

  abstract = {Dispersal and colonization of new areas by armored scale insects (Hemiptera: Diaspididae) is achieved by mobile first-instar nymphs, called crawlers. Few studies have considered the actual mechanisms by which crawlers disperse, and although crawlers are capable of actively wandering over short distances (generally {$<$} 1 m), their dispersal over longer distances has been thought to be wind-mediated. Here, we present evidence of a potentially more important means of dispersal over longer distances ({$>$} 1 m). We first confirmed that crawlers of four species of Diaspididae [Abgrallaspis aguacatae Evans, Watson \& Miller; Hemiberlesia lataniae (Signoret); Aspidiotus nerii Bouché; and Diaspidiotus perniciosus (Comstock)] have four hairs on the end of each of their legs and that each of these hairs ends in a suction cup-like structure, reminiscent of the attachment structures possessed by phoretic mites. In a controlled environment, using crawlers of A. nerii, we then showed that the crawlers use these structures to attach themselves to three different insect species [Musca domestica L., Cryptolaemus montrouzieri Mulsant and Linepithema humile (Mayr)] and can effectively be moved phoretically by these insects. Crawlers can remain attached to flying insects for considerable periods of time, suggesting that this may be an important means of dispersal for armored scale insects. The importance of phoresy for diaspidid dispersal in the field remains to be determined.},

Beauv., and Vitex parviflora Juss. modified soils in Guam\&rsquo;s limestone forests, reducing storage pools of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus. Background and Objectives: Invasive plants may engineer negative changes in ecosystem properties. This study was conducted to determine changes in soil chemistry following infestations of three problematic tree species on Guam. Materials and Methods: Minerals, metals, and mineralization dynamics were measured in invaded sites and paired sites with biodiverse native tree cover. Results: Most soil properties were significantly changed by long-term infestations of the invasive tree species. The soils within invaded sites exhibited total carbon, total nitrogen, and available phosphorus that were less than native sites. In contrast, the carbon/nitrogen ratio increased for every species-site combination. The other chemical properties were idiosyncratic among the sites and species. Conclusions: Mitigation and restoration activities that include the removal of these trees from project sites may require many years for the below-ground ecosystems to return to their native state. These three invasive trees decrease the ability of Guam soils to sequester recalcitrant forms of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus.},

The small size of this cycad pest and complex surface morphology of the host cycad organs combine to make visual detection of every cryptic infestation difficult or impossible to achieve. The international movement of Cycas revoluta Thunb. nursery plants and the presence of C. revoluta nursery industries in so many countries have enabled this pest to wreak havoc on the international cycad horticulture trade over the last 25 years. The short pre-oviposition period and considerable female fecundity lead to rapid population expansion on the plants initially infested in newly invaded regions. A depletion of non-structural carbohydrates accompanies long-term infestations and precedes plant death. Enemy escape within the invasive range allows the scale population growth to remain unchecked until anthropogenic efforts establish non-native biological control.},

We established 120 plots in Cycas micronesica habitats throughout Guam in 2005 following the invasion of the armored scale Aulacaspis yasumatsui, then observed plant mortality through 2020. We used transects in Yap as benchmarks, as the Yap C. micronesica population is not threatened. The initial Guam plots contained about 1600 seedlings, 1160 juveniles, and 1240 mature plants per ha. Seedling mortality was 100\% by 2006, juvenile mortality was 100\% by 2014, and the 2020 census revealed 96\% mortality of the plant population. Localities in western Guam and isolated forest fragments exhibited the greatest mortality, with 100\% extirpation from two fragmented western localities. The juvenile and mature trees in Yap were unchanged from 2010 to 2018, but the seedling count was heterogeneous among the years. Constrained recruitment from seedlings to juveniles explained these dynamics. Yap transects contained about 6120 seedlings, 3400 juveniles, and 1250 mature plants per ha. Biological control of the invasive insects remains the acute conservation action needed for the Guam population. Lessons learned may be useful in other regions where invasions of non-native pests threaten biodiversity.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros; CRB) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s has enabled the successful management of populations in Pacific Island Countries (PICs). Augmentative release of OrNV continues to be an important mechanism for CRB management in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. For \textasciitilde 40 years after adoption of this biocontrol strategy, no new outbreaks of CRB were reported from uninfested palm growing countries and islands in the Pacific ensuring continuity of palm based village economies. However, the situation has recently changed. For first time in \textasciitilde 40 years, CRB invasion into completely new areas has been reported in the Pacific, being detected first in Tumon Bay in Guam 2007, followed by Port Moresby in PNG 2010, Honolulu in Hawaii 2013, and Honiara in Solomon Islands 2015. Additionally, Pacific areas with established CRB populations (e.g. Palau) have reported increased severity and frequency of CRB damage. Common to all these areas is the high incidence of severe palm damage, not seen since the introduction of OrNV. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam CRB population were unexpectedly unsuccessful, raising the possibility that the CRB-G population that invaded Guam could be tolerant or resistant to the commonly applied OrNV isolates. Analysis of several CRB populations has demonstrated that the CRB-G biotype is also found in Hawaii, Palau, and recently (February 2015) in Port Moresby (PNG), with Honiara (Solomon Islands) still to be confirmed. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.},

  abstract = {The coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB; Oryctes rhinoceros) is a major pest of coconut and oil palm, but the discovery and release of Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s and 70s suppressed the pest such that no new invasions of uninfested islands by CRB were reported for over 30years after implementation of the biocontrol programme. Surprisingly, a highly damaging outbreak was reported from Guam (2007), which could not be controlled by OrNV. Subsequently, new invasions have been reported from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea (2009); O’ahu, Hawai’i (2013); and Honiara, Solomon Islands (2015). We have found that all of these outbreaks have been caused by a previously unrecognized haplotype, CRB-G, which appears to be tolerant to OrNV. PCR analysis shows that OrNV is generally present at high incidence in established populations of CRB, but is generally absent from the invasive CRB-G populations. CRB-G from Guam was not susceptible to OrNV infection by oral delivery, but injection of the virus did cause mortality. Further genetic analysis shows that CRB populations can be divided into a number of clades that coincide with the endemic and invasive history of the beetle. Analysis suggests that CRB-G originated in Asia, though the precise location remains to be discovered.},

  abstract = {The discovery of Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV) in the 1960s by Dr Alois Huger enabled the successful management of coconut rhinoceros beetle (Orytes rhinoceros) populations through classical biocontrol release in the Pacific, SE Asian, and Indian Ocean regions. OrNV continues to be an important biocontrol agent for the control of Oryctes rhinoceros in both coconut and oil palm growing regions. Augmentative release of OrNV is commonly used to enhance the natural spread and ensure its continued presence within palm growing regions and surrounding areas. For over four decades after the distribution of the virus, O. rhinoceros was not reported to have established in any new regions. However, in 2007 the beetle was discovered in Guam and the population has now established with a highly damaging outbreak such as those not seen for 40+ years. Initial attempts to introduce OrNV into the Guam population were unexpectedly unsuccessful. This has raised the possibility the O. rhinoceros population that invaded Guam is less susceptible to OrNV, or potentially resistant. Furthermore, near the end of 2013, a population of O. rhinoceros was detected in Hawaii, although it is not believed to have established yet. The discovery of new O. rhinoceros invasions within the Pacific region linked with the possibility of a virus tolerant population suggests the beetle may again be on the move. To assist efforts in identifying the source populations for the Guam outbreak, a simple PCR-RFLP method has been developed to distinguish Guam O. rhinoceros from other populations. Analysis of several O. rhinoceros populations has demonstrated that the Hawaiian beetles are of the same haplotype as those found in Guam. We will discuss current results in relation to what is known about these new invasions and potential implications for the future.},

  abstract = {The yellow‐legged Asian hornet is an invasive species of wasps, indigenous to the Southeast Asia but recently spreading in Southern Europe. Because of its exponential diffusion and its serious threat to the local honeybee colonies (and to humans as well), restraint measures are currently under investigation. We developed and tested an harmonic radar capable of tracking the flying trajectory of these insects, once equipped with a small transponder, in their natural environment. Several hornets were captured close to a small cluster of honeybee hives, tagged with different transponders and then released in order to follow the flight toward their nest. On‐field testing proved an initial maximum detection range of about 125~m in a hilly and woody area. A number of detections were clearly recorded, and preferential directions of flight were identified. The system herein described is intended as a first low‐cost harmonic radar; it proved the capability to track the hornets while flying and it permitted to test the tagging techniques. Several upgrades of the system have been identified during this work and are extensively described in the last chapter. The designed system has three major advantages over conventional harmonic radars. First and most importantly, it adopts advanced processing techniques to suppress clutter and to improve target detection. Second, it allows radar operations in complex environments, generally hilly and rich in vegetation. Finally, it can continuously track tagged insects (24/7) and in any meteorological condition, providing an effective tool in order to locate the nests of the yellow‐legged Asian hornet.},

  abstract = {Understanding the flight characteristics of insect pests is essential for designing effective strategies and programs for their management. In this study, we designed, constructed, and validated the performance of modern flight-testing systems (flight mill and flight tunnel) for studying the flight behavior of red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier) under a controlled atmosphere. The flight-testing mill consisted of a flight mill, a testing chamber with an automatically controlled microclimate, and a data logging and processing unit. The data logging and processing unit consisted of a USB digital oscilloscope connected with a laptop. We used MATLAB 2020A to implement a graphical user interface (GUI) for real-time sampling and data processing. The flight-testing tunnel was fitted with a horizontal video camera to photograph the insects during flight. The program of Image-Pro plus V 10.0.8 was used for image processing and numerical data analysis to determine weevil tracking. The mean flight speed of RPW was 82.12 ± 8.5 m/min, and the RPW stopped flying at the temperature of 20 °C. The RPW flight speed in the flight tunnel was slightly higher than that on the flight mill. The angular deceleration was 0.797 rad/s2, and the centripetal force was 0.0203 N when a RPW tethered to the end of the rotating arm. The calculated moment of inertia of the RPW mass and the flight mill’s rotating components was 9.521 × 10−3 N m2. The minimum thrust force needed to rotate the flight mill was 1.98 × 10−3 N. Therefore, the minimum power required to rotate the flight mill with the mean revolution per min of 58.02 rpm was approximately 2.589 × 10−3 W. The designed flight-testing systems and their applied software proved productive and useful tools in unveiling essential flight characteristics of test insects in the laboratory.},

  abstract = {Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB) was first detected on Guam during 2007. Following a failed eradication program, we attempted to establish effective microbial control using Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) imported from AgResearch New Zealand and green muscardine fungus (GMF), Metarhizium majus, imported from the Philippine Coconut Authority. OrNV was initially released by autodissemination but did not result in population suppression. Molecular analyses indicated that the Guam population is genetically distinct from other populations which had invaded Pacific Islands and laboratory bioassays indicated that this genotype is resistant to infection by OrNV isolates commonly used and released in the Pacific region. This novel biotype has been named CRB Biotype G (CRB-G) and it is spreading throughout the Pacific. GMF was released by autodissemination and incorporation of spores into CRB breeding sites. An extensive post- release survey indicated that field mortality from GMF was between 10\% and 38\%. Population suppression by GMF coupled with breeding site sanitation and other integrated pest management tactics did not prevent an uncontrolled island-wide CRB outbreak triggered by Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Adults emerging from abundant CRB breeding sites generated by this typhoon were numerous enough to kill large numbers of mature coconuts, initiating a positive feedback cycle whereby adults emerging from dead palms kill even more palms. History indicates that the most feasible way to stop the current outbreak on Guam is to find and release an OrNV isolate which is pathogenic for CRB-G. We are currently locating populations of CRB-G biotype within its native range and looking for OrNV isolates from these populations which can be used for effective microbial control.},

  abstract = {Abstract for a presentation at the~Western Forest Insect Work Conference, April 1, 2014. Biological Invasion of Forests on Guam and Other Islands in Micronesia Aubrey Moore Cooperative Extension Service / Western Pacific Tropical Research Center College of Natural and Applied Sciences University of Guam, Mangilao, Guam American affiliated island groups in Micronesia include the Territory of Guam, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), the Republic of Palau, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia, which includes the states of Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and Kosrae. As the name suggests, the 2,100 islands in Micronesia are small, with Guam being the largest at 212 square miles. Micronesia's forests are under severe attack from invasive species. The most important are: Ungulates. Pigs and deer were imported for food and caribao (water buffalo) were imported as beasts of burden during colonial times. Prior to WWII, these ungulates were not a problem on Guam because populations were controlled by human hunters. However, access to hunters was denied on most of the one-third of Guam land occupied by the U.S. military. Subsequently, in the absence of predation from natural enemies, ungulate populations have become very high, destroying much of the native forest. Brown treesnake (BTS), Boiga irregularis. Guam's avifauna was extirpated by BTS which arrived shortly after WWII. Cascading effects include loss of ecosystem services provided by birds and other vertebrates such as seed dispersal, insectivory and pollination. Extirpation of birds and other vertebrate insectivores by BTS predation has resulted in high populations of herbivorous invertebrates in Guam's forests. Cycad Aulacaspis scale (CAS), Aulacaspis yasumatsui. The infestation of this armored scale was first detected on ornamental cycads on Guam in the fall of 2003 but it rapidly spread to Guam' s wild, endemic Cycas micronesica population and later to wild cycads in the CNMI and Palau. This is a classic case of 'escape from natural enemies'. Plant mortality from the scale infestation was so severe that C. micronesica was placed on the IUCN list of threatened species in 2005. Only three years prior, in 2002, a forest survey found C. micronesica to be the most numerous tree in Guam's forests. This plant is still under attack by CAS and several other recently arrived invasive species. Mortality exceeds 90\% in some forest plots and there is no reproduction. Coconut rhinoceros beetle (CRB), Oryctes rhinoceros. CRB was first detected in Palau just after WWII and on Guam in 2007. Coconut palms, listed as Guam's second most numerous tree in a 2002 forest survey, can be killed by adults which bore into the crowns to feed on sap. Following a failed attempt to eradicate CRB, efforts on Guam are now aimed at developing integrated pest management. Little fire ant (LFA), Wasmannia auropunctata. LFA was first detected on Guam in 2011 at about a dozen distinct sites. LFA devastates the forest by killing wildlife and other arthropods, except for phytophagous hemipterans which are protected in return for honey dew. To date, funds and other resources have not been identified to eradicate or otherwise control this pest. A major impediment to controlling forest pests in Guam and the rest of Micronesia is a lack of professional capacity. During the past 20 years, the number of PhD level entomologists and plant pathologists practicing in the region has declined from 9 to 3 and from 4 to 1, respectively. During this same period, detections of invasive species affecting forestry and agriculture have increased greatly as a result of globalization and relaxed biosecurity. Coupled with 'the taxonomic impediment', these factors have lead to a gross under-reporting of impacts of invasive species in Micronesia.},

  abstract = {Guam's ecosystems are under attack by invasive species. Many people know about extinction of Guam's birds by the brown tree snake which invaded the island shortly after WWII. But the contemporary ecological disaster which is currently happening in Guam's forests is not well known. In 2002 a US Forest Service survey found the endemic cycad, Cycas micronesica, to be the most abundant tree in Guam's forests and coconut palm, Cocos nucifera, to be the second most abundant tree. Both species are now under severe attack by invasive insect species. About 90\% of C. micronesica trees have been killed by Asian cycad scale, Aulacaspis yasumatsui, first detected in 2003. The predatory beetle, Rhyzobius lophanthae, was introduced and it is protecting mature plants but no seedlings are surviving. Coconut rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinoceros, was first detected in 2007 and an uncontrolled outbreak of this pest is currently killing coconut palms throughout the island. Following a failed eradication attempt, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV) and Metarhizium majus fungus were introduced as biocontrol agents. OrNV unexpectedly failed as a biocontrol agent for CRB on Guam. Previously, this pathogen produced excellent results when released on Pacific Islands infested with CRB. Subsequent laboratory bioassays and genetic analysis showed that the CRB which invaded Guam belong to an OrNV resistant biotype named CRB-G which is involved in all recent invasions of CRB in the Pacific. The fungus, M. majus rapidly established and spread to CRB breeding sites throughout the island, with infection rates measured between 10\% and 38\%. But this level of suppression was not enough to prevent the current outbreak which was triggered by abundant breeding sites left in the wake of Typhoon Dolphin which passed over Guam in May 2015. Attempts to overcome these IPM failures will be discussed.},

  author = {Moore, Aubrey},
  date = {2017},
  abstract = {Introduction: O. rhinoceros (coconut rhinoceros beetle; CRB), a major pest of coconut and other palms was first detected on Guam in 2007. Adults damage and sometimes kill palms when they bore into crowns to feed on sap. Grubs feed on decaying vegetation. Massive amounts of decaying vegetation generated by typhoons, agricultural activities, or war may initiate a positive feedback cycle whereby palms killed by adults become breeding sites producing even more adults. Method: Eradication was attempted, but failed when the CRB population spread to all parts of the island by 2010. Attempted implementation of classical biological control using Oryctes nudivirus (OrNV), the preferred biocontrol agent for CRB, also failed. Metarhizium majus was successfully introduced, spread naturally, and is killing about 20\% of grubs before they become adults. Improved pheromone traps equipped with solar-powered ultraviolet light emitting diodes catch more than 10 times as many beetles as standard pheromone traps for CRB. Fish gill nets are being draped over piles of green waste to trap beetles attempting to leave or enter these potential breeding sites. Dogs and radio- tagged CRB were used to discover cryptic breeding sites. However, island-wide population suppression by these methods has recently been overwhelmed by massive numbers of adults emerging from abundant breeding sites created by Typhoon Dolphin which visited Guam in May 2015. Results/Conclusion: Without an effective density- dependent biocontrol agent, such as an OrNV isolate which is highly pathogenic for the CRB-Guam biotype, many if not most palms on Guam will be killed by CRB.},

They are extremely invasive, and many species are serious agricultural pests. They are also emerging models for studies of the evolution of genetic systems, endosymbiosis and plant-insect interactions. ScaleNet was launched in 1995 to provide insect identifiers, pest managers, insect systematists, evolutionary biologists and ecologists efficient access to information about scale insect biological diversity. It provides comprehensive information on scale insects taken directly from the primary literature. Currently, it draws from 23 477 articles and describes the systematics and biology of 8194 valid species. For 20 years, ScaleNet ran on the same software platform. That platform is no longer viable. Here, we present a new, open-source implementation of ScaleNet. We have normalized the data model, begun the process of correcting invalid data, upgraded the user interface, and added online administrative tools. These improvements make ScaleNet easier to use and maintain and make the ScaleNet data more accurate and extendable. Database URL: http://scalenet.info},

  abstract = {Since 1911, over 100 species of exotic organisms have been deliberately introduced for biological control of various pests on Guam. Of these, 27 species were released against seven lepidopterous pests including one butterfly and one skipper. Recently, concern has mounted about the negative effects of these introduced biocontrol agents on nontarget species, particularly endemic island species. Guam may have suffered extinction of as much as 20-25\% of its butterfly fauna. To determine the extent of movement and possible impacts of biocontrol agents on nontarget butterflies, mortality factors affecting juvenile stages of Hypolimnas anomala (Wallace) and Hypolimnas bolina (L.) were studied. Both species were attacked by the same parasitoids and predators, which included native, accidentally introduced, and deliberately introduced species. Parasitoids killed 2.4\% of the eggs of H. anomala, and ants removed about 25\% of the eggs. Parasitization was about 40\% in H. bolina, and ants killed about 35\% of the eggs. One species introduced for biological control, Trichogramma chilonis Ishii, was found parasitizing the eggs, but it caused little mortality. No larval parasites were reared for either species. H. anomala suffered heavy mortality from a disease. Both species were attacked by ants and two exotic, self-introduced predators. The major pupal parasite was Brachymeria lasus (Walker), a deliberate biological control introduction. B. lasus parasitized 24.6\% of the pupae of H. bolina and 2.9\% of those of H. anomala. Ants attacked 17\% of H. anomala pupae and 7\% of those of H. bolina. B. lasus and T. chilonis are polyphagous parasitoids that have the potential to affect a variety of nontarget species. This type of parasitoid, and highly polyphagous predators like ants, should require more intensive evaluation and review for use in classical biological control programs than more specialized species.},

Vacated leafmines of this or a related species have also been recorded from Tinian and Alamagan. These provide the first records of the Nepticulidae from Micronesia. Similar mines, probably of a related species, have been recorded from herbarium material of Maoutia australis Wedd. originating from Tahiti; these confirm the occurrence of the family in Polynesia. Adult and mines of S. ebbenielseni are described and illustrated. The literature on Microlepidoptera of Pacific islands is reviewed and previous records of Nepticulidae are discussed. We conclude that Stigmella is probably widespread in the Pacific area, with at least four species, currently all associated with Urticaceae, tribe Boehmeriae.},

  abstract = {Working with the University of Guam, experts at the University of Florida have identified the tiny bark beetle which is attacking Guam’s nanåsu plants, also known as beach naupaka or by its scientific name,~Scaevola~taccada. Nanåsu is a major component of the beach strand community on Pacific Islands where it is also used as an ornamental landscaping plant. Ironically, this same plant species is considered to be an invasive species in Florida and the Caribbean (CABI 2017). A few weeks ago Ilene Quitugua, a contractor who monitors the health of landscape plants for the Guam Visitor’s Bureau (GVB) and Denson Fairfield, Landscape Management Systems, a company that maintains landscapes for GVB, noticed that nanåsu plants used in ornamental hedges throughout Tumon Bay were starting to die.~ The University of Guam College of Natural and Applied Sciences Extension and Outreach (UOG-CNAS-EO) was contacted and asked to investigate the cause of the problem and make recommendations for solving it. UOG-CNAS-EO extension agent Phoebe Wall and UOG-CNAS-EO entomologist Dr. Aubrey Moore collected plant samples. When dead and dying branches were cut open and examined under a microscope, Moore found many minute bark beetles feeding inside. Images were taken and sent to Dr. Jiri Hulcr at the University of Florida who is a world expert on bark beetles. Dr. Hulcr kindly offered to help identify the beetles and asked for specimens to be sent to him. Getting the scientific name for a pest unlocks the global knowledge base for that species. This allows us to answer questions such as: • Is this an invasive species (a species from elsewhere which is likely to cause harm)? • What is the range of plants that the pest feeds on, and what kind of damage does it do? • What methods have been used to successfully control the pest? • Does the pest transmit plant pathogens? Accurate identification of insect pests is very important and far more difficult than most people expect. Species determination is usually performed by highly skilled taxonomists who specialize in a relatively small group of species. Bark beetles are among the hardest insects to identify. They belong to a family of beetles called Curculionidae, which contains more than 86,000 species and~many~more yet to be described. Specimens from Guam arrived at the University of Florida this week and were identified as~Hemicryphalus~argutus~by Andrew Johnson, a graduate student working in~Hulcr’s~lab. Johnson is the world’s leading taxonomist in a huge group of tiny bark beetles known as~Cryphalini,~or the pygmy borers. Almost nothing is known about this species. The only previous record is from specimens collected on Saipan during 1944 and 1945 (Wood 1960).~ Although this is the first time~H.~argutus~has been observed on Guam, it is probably not an invasive species. Moore thinks it is likely that this is an endemic species, meaning that it evolved on Guam and~other Mariana Islands. So why are we seeing what is becoming known as~Scaevola~dieback? One possible cause to be investigated is plant pathogens. Many species of bark beetles related to~H.~argutus~infect plants with fungus on which they feed. It is the fungus that actually kills the plant, not the tiny beetles. Or, we may have the wrong suspect. The plot thickens as the~Scaevola~dieback investigation proceeds. (PR)},

  abstract = {SUVA, Fiji—The Pacific Community is taking proactive measures to assist Samoa and other Pacific Island countries and territories in their efforts to curb any resurgence of the coconut rhinoceros beetle. SPC, with support from AgResearch New Zealand, has dispatched to Samoa’s Ministry of Agriculture 1,000 sachets of male aggregate pheromones, called Oryctalure, to trap these beetles (Oryctes rhinoceros) which can cause severe damage when they bore into the crowns of coconut palms to feed on sap. Coconut palms cover around 30 percent of Samoa’s land mass and contribute SAT\$8 million annually to the Pacific Island nation’s economy. In 2007 the total value of exports of coconut products from Fiji, Solomon Islands, Vanuatu, Samoa and Kiribati was valued at €14.4 million. The use of male aggregate pheromones, such as Oryctalure, has proven effective in suppressing the beetle’s population and could assist in preventing the spread of a new strain, called the Guam biotype. The Guam biotype beetle, believed to be highly invasive and capable of inflicting severe damage to palms, poses a real threat to food security and socio-economic development of Pacific Island nations. “This new strain of coconut rhinoceros beetle is already present in Guam, the mainland of Papua New Guinea, Palau, Hawaii and Guadalcanal in Solomon Islands and comprehensive research is needed to determine the effectiveness of different pheromones on different beetle biotypes,” SPC entomologist Dr. Maclean Vaqalo explained. “One sachet of the pheromones we have sent to Samoa’s Ministry of Agriculture can last up to three months in a trap, depending on environmental conditions.~ This is an immediate measure that will be used as an early warning system to monitor the likely presence of the Guam biotype, especially at high quarantine risk areas,” Vaqalo said. Coconut and similar palms thrive in regions where there is no cold season and minimal dry season and, as a result, the coconut rhinoceros beetles are able to reproduce throughout the year. “SPC, with support from regional scientists, has recently drafted a regional approach to effectively control this new strain of beetle which addresses emergence response and quarantine awareness, exploration of effective biological control measures, and outreach to farming communities to adopt integrated pest management best practices,” Vaqalo said. The regional approach was agreed to and supported by plant protectionists in the region during the Pacific Plant Protection Organization and Regional Technical Meeting of Plant Protection meetings held in Nadi, Fiji, in September 2015. “We’re also providing technical advice and assistance on biosecurity, quarantine and integrated pest management measures for the coconut rhinoceros beetle,” Vaqalo said. The regional approach in the area of biosecurity awareness, emergence response and management of the beetle biotypes in the region will only work well if funding is forthcoming to implement the work plan.~ SPC looks forward to working with Pacific countries and territories, as well as scientific institutions and fund donors from within the region and abroad to address the regional approach.

  abstract = {During the XXVth International Congress of Entomology in Orlando, Florida (Sept. 25-30, 2016), the largest gathering of its kind ever held, scientists met in a special symposium to find answers to the problem of invasive scarab beetles, damaging species that are spreading around the globe. The meeting was timely, with reports of a new, highly damaging biotype of the coconut rhinoceros beetle recently established in a number of Pacific Islands, including Hawaii, and reports of the ornamental and turf damaging Japanese beetle established for the first time on the European continent in Italy. The scientists were concerned that increasing international transport and new races of pests are challenging our quarantine systems and will result in severe and ongoing damage once they break through. A new biotype of the coconut rhinoceros beetle poses a special threat. The pest has invaded Guam, where entomologist Dr. Aubrey Moore predicts that if effective control measures cannot be found more than 50 percent of the palms on the island will be killed by the pest. The damaging beetle was found to belong to a new biotype by AgResearch New Zealand scientist Dr. Sean Marshall and has since been found causing heavy damage on a number of other Pacific Islands. The beetle has established a beachhead in Hawaii where Project Operations Manager Dr. Darcy Oishi is running a multi-million dollar program to contain and eradicate the pest. Representative of the Pacific Community, Dr. Maclean Vaqalo, said the real threat is to the small countries and atolls of the Pacific where the coconut tree is the “tree of life,” providing essential food and shelter to the people. If nothing is done to help the small island states in the Pacific to contain the pest it will simply re-invade the cleared areas and may even reach the American continents. A special meeting was called by Phil Andreozzi of the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service to take advantage of the presence of the assembled scientists to develop a plan to address the problem of the coconut rhinoceros beetle in the Pacific. The expert team began work on an operational framework and established working groups to increase awareness of the problem, plan emergency responses, enhance biosecurity, and look for long-term biological solutions. Participants were pleased with the meeting and the opportunity offered by ICE to start to address the problem in a coordinated fashion to overcome this severe threat as soon as possible. Guam was represented at the meeting by University of Guam entomologists Dr. Aubrey Moore and Dr. Ross Miller.},

  doi = {10.1186/s40562-016-0041-8},
  abstract = {An earth-science-based classification of islands within the Pacific Basin resulted from the preparation of a database describing the location, area, and type of 1779 islands, where island type is determined as a function of the prevailing lithology and maximum elevation of each island, with an island defined as a discrete landmass composed of a contiguous land area ≥1 ha (0.01 km²) above mean high-water level. Reefs lacking islands and short-lived ({$<$}20 years) transient islands are not included. The principal aim of the classification is to assess the spatial diversity of the geologic and geomorphic attributes of Pacific islands. It is intended to be valid at a regional scale and based on two attributes: five types of lithology (volcanic, limestone, composite, continental, surficial) and a distinction between high and low islands. These attributes yielded eight island types: volcanic high and low islands; limestone high and low islands; composite high and low islands; reef (including all unconsolidated) islands; and continental islands. Most common are reef islands (36 \%) and volcanic high islands (31 \%), whereas the least common are composite low islands (1 \%). Continental islands, 18 of the 1779 islands examined, are not included in maps showing the distribution of island attributes and types. Rationale for the spatial distributions of the various island attributes is drawn from the available literature and canvassed in the text. With exception of the few continental islands, the distribution of island types is broadly interpretable from the proximity of island-forming processes. It is anticipated the classification will become the basis for more focused investigation of spatial variability of the climate and ocean setting as well as the biological attributes of Pacific islands. It may also be used in spatial assessments of second-order phenomena associated with the islands, such as their vulnerability to various disasters, coastal erosion, or ocean pollution as well as human populations, built infrastructure and natural resources.},

  abstract = {We present scAnt, an open-source platform for the creation of digital 3D models of arthropods and small objects. scAnt consists of a scanner and a Graphical User Interface, and enables the automated generation of Extended Depth Of Field images from multiple perspectives. These images are then masked with a novel automatic routine which combines random forest-based edge-detection, adaptive thresholding and connected component labelling. The masked images can then be processed further with a photogrammetry software package of choice, including open-source options such as Meshroom, to create high-quality, textured 3D models. We demonstrate how these 3D models can be rigged to enable realistic digital specimen posing, and introduce a novel simple yet effective method to include semi-realistic representations of approximately planar and transparent structures such as wings. As a result of the exclusive reliance on generic hardware components, rapid prototyping and open-source software, scAnt costs only a fraction of available comparable systems. The resulting accessibility of scAnt will (i) drive the development of novel and powerful methods for machine learning-driven behavioural studies, leveraging synthetic data; (ii) increase accuracy in comparative morphometric studies as well as extend the available parameter space with area and volume measurements; (iii) inspire novel forms of outreach; and (iv) aid in the digitisation efforts currently underway in several major natural history collections.},

  abstract = {An intricate network of interactions between organisms and their environment form the ecosystems that sustain life on earth. With a detailed understanding of these interactions, ecologists and biologists can make better informed predictions about the ways different environmental factors will impact ecosystems. Despite the abundance of research data on biotic and abiotic interactions, no comprehensive and easily accessible data collection is available that spans taxonomic, geospatial, and temporal domains. Biotic-interaction datasets are effectively siloed, inhibiting cross-dataset comparisons. In order to pool resources and bring to light individual datasets, specialized research tools are needed to aggregate, normalize, and integrate existing datasets with standard taxonomies, ontologies, vocabularies, and structured data repositories. Global Biotic Interactions (GloBI) provides such tools by way of an open, community-driven infrastructure designed to lower the barrier for researchers to perform ecological systems analysis and modeling. GloBI provides a tool that (a) ingests, normalizes, and aggregates datasets, (b) integrates interoperable data with accepted ontologies (e.g., OBO Relations Ontology, Uberon, and Environment Ontology), vocabularies (e.g., Coastal and Marine Ecological Classification Standard), and taxonomies (e.g., Integrated Taxonomic Information System and National Center for Biotechnology Information Taxonomy Database), (c) makes data accessible through an application programming interface (API) and various data archives (Darwin Core, Turtle, and Neo4j), and (d) houses a data collection of about 700,000 species interactions across about 50,000 taxa, covering over 1100 references from 19 data sources. GloBI has taken an open-source and open-data approach in order to make integrated species-interaction data maximally accessible and to encourage users to provide feedback, contribute data, and improve data access methods. The GloBI collection of datasets is currently used in the Encyclopedia of Life (EOL) and Gulf of Mexico Species Interactions (GoMexSI).},

The e-trap examines the spectral content of the wingbeat of the insect flying in and reports wirelessly counts and species identity. We design our devices so that they are optimized in terms of detection accuracy and power consumption, but above all, we ensure that they are affordable. Our aim is to make more widespread the use of electronic insect traps that report in virtually real time the level of the pest population from the field straight to a human controlled agency. We have the vision to establish remote automated monitoring for all insects of economic and hygienic importance at large spatial scales, using their wingbeat as biometric evidence. To this end, we provide open access to the implementation details, recordings, and classification code we developed.},

  abstract = {Dynastinae beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) are important due to their role in recycling plant material and promoting nutrient turnover. However, some species are phytophagous and can attack crop plants, thus becoming pests. Here, we provide information on the biology and behavior of the rhinoceros beetle Enema pan (F.) (Oryctini), an abundant species in the area of Cerrado-Pantanal ecotone, Aquidauana, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Adults were collected with a light trap deployed daily from January 2006 to December 2007 in the experimental farm of the Universidade Estadual de Mato Grosso do Sul (Aquidauana campus). Adults were maintained in plastic containers and observations were made daily. Temporal distribution of adults of E. pan occurred in September and October (2006) and from October to December (2007). Flight started at 1930 hours and ended at 2330 hours. Twenty-four eggs (3.28 mm in length by 2.32 mm in width) with a whitish color were ovipositioned directly in to the soil. Adult longevity averaged 22.0 d in the laboratory conditions. Cephalic horn length, body length, and width of E. pan males are greater than those of females. The weight of adults of both sexes was similar. Cephalic horn length of the males of E. pan was positively correlated with his body size. Mating occurred between 0800 and 1030 hours and lasted on average 18.1 min in the laboratory. Several fights among males and other behaviors involving males and females were observed and are reported. © 2011 Entomological Society of America.},

However, little is known about growth and metabolism of this cell line, knowledge of which is necessary to develop an in vitro large-scale OrNV production process. The strong anchorage-dependent characteristics of the cell line, its particular fragility and its tendency to form dense clumps when manipulated, are the most likely reasons that have precluded further development of the cell line. In order to characterize DSIR-HA-1179 cells, there was first a need for a reliable technique to count the cells. A homogenous cell suspension suitable for enumeration could be produced by treatment with TrypLE Express™ with optimum mean time for cell release calculated as 30 min. The cell line was adapted to grow in four serum-supplemented culture media namely TC-100, IPL-41, Sf-900 II and Sf-900 III and cell growth, glucose consumption, lactate and ammonia production were assessed from static-batch cultures. The maximum viable cell density was reached in Sf-900 II (17.9 × 10(5) cells/ml), with the maximum specific growth rate observed in this culture medium as well (0.0074 h(-1)). Higher production of OrNV was observed in IPL-41 and TC-100 (4.1 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) than in cultures infected in Sf-900 III (2.0 × 10(7) TCID50/ml) and Sf-900 II (1.4 × 10(7) TCID50/ml). At the end of the growth period, glucose was completely consumed in cultures grown in TC-100, while remained in excess in the other three culture media. The cell line produced lactate and ammonia to very low levels in the TC-100 culture medium which is a promising aspect for its cultivation at large-scale.},

A survey of adult beetles was carried out throughout Malaysia using pheromone traps. Captured beetles were examined for presence of virus using both visual/microscopic examination and PCR detection methods. The survey indicated that Oryctes virus was common in Malaysia among the adult beetles. Viral DNA analysis was carried out after restriction with HindIII enzyme and indicated at least three distinct viral genotypes. Bioassays were used to compare the viral strains and demonstrate that one strain (type B) is the most virulent against both larvae and adults of the beetle. Virus type B has been cultured and released into healthy populations where another strain (type A) forms the natural background. Capture and examination of beetles from the release site and surrounding area has shown that the spread and persistence of the applied virus strain is accompanied by a reduction in palm frond damage.},

Six additional LFA infestations were identified at private residences   and small farms along the southwest coast of the island. Surveillance surveys sug-   gest that LFA has yet to spread to the neighboring islands of the Commonwealth   of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), or elsewhere in Micronesia. The spread   of LFA to and throughout Guam is most likely due to human transport of infested   plant material from LFA infested areas of Hawaii, Australia, or the U.S. mainland.   The devastating effects of LFA on agriculture and forest ecosystems observed in   LFA infested areas elsewhere are likely to occur on Guam and other Micronesian   islands infested by LFA. Some LFA infestations on Guam may be eradicable using   control techniques in use in Hawaii and other Pacific Basin countries.},

  abstract = {Summary and Conclusions Two surveys of the mosquitoes of Guam in the post-World War II period have provided new data of value to persons concerned with mosquito control and epidemiological investigations on diseases of man. In these studies two species of mosquitoes are recorded from Guam for the first time: Aedes albopictus and Anopheles subpictus indefinitus. The latter record is the first of an Anopheles imported and established in the Central Pacific Area. It is felt that both of these species were introduced in the period following 1945, but there is no indication of the way in which this occurred. Interpretation of data on the biology of the adult stage of the 11 species now known from Guam, coupled with a review of their known disease vector abilities, has permitted a re-evaluation of the relative potential importance of the various species as vectors of human disease. It is concluded that as vectors of Japanese B encephalitis the following species should be kept under surveillance: Culex quinquefasciatus, Culex annulirostris marinae, Aedes vexans nocturnus, Aedes albopictus and Aedes pandani. Laboratory tests for encephalitis viruses on 20,361 mosquitoes representing 6 species have been negative. For dengue fever only Aedes albopictus would be suspected as a vector at this time. This opinion is influenced by the almost complete disappearance of Aedes aegypti, possibly due to earlier intensive control activities. Because of the habits of Anopheles subpictus indefinitus, the possibility of autochthonous malaria is believed to be minimal. It is felt that nocturnal filariasis might well be introduced and become endemic through the vector activities of Culex quinquefasciatus. A sample of 2,261 larval collections have been analyzed as to larval habitats, association of various species and monthly distribution of sources. It is concluded that the majority of domestic pest and potential disease vector mosquitoes have come from sources directly attributable to the activities of man, namely, domestic water receptacles and domestic and military refuse. It is suggested that any program for mosquito control on Guam should be aimed at the detection and correction or elimination of these mosquito sources. In the immediate vicinity of heavily populated areas, inspection and abatement of mosquito sources in ground pools and water collections in plants and coconut shells would be an important adjunct to this program during and immediately following the rainy season.}

  abstract = {The Burmese python, Python bivittatus Kuhl, is a well-established invasive species in the greater Everglades ecosystem of southern Florida, USA. Most research on its ecological impacts focuses on its role as a predator and its trophic interactions with native vertebrate species, particularly mammals. Beyond predation, there is little known about the ecological interactions between P. bivittatus and native faunal communities. It is likely that established populations of P. bivittatus in southern Florida serve as hosts for native mosquito communities. To test this concept, we used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I DNA barcoding to determine the hosts of blood fed mosquitoes collected at a research facility in northern Florida where captive P. bivittatus and Argentine black and white tegu, Salvator merianae (Duméril and Bibron), are maintained in outdoor enclosures, accessible to local mosquitoes. We recovered python DNA from the blood meals of three species of Culex mosquitoes: Culex erraticus (Dyar and Knab), Culex quinquefasciatus Say, and Culex pilosus (Dyar and Knab). Culex erraticus conclusively (P = 0.001; Fisher’s Exact Test) took more blood meals from P. bivittatus than from any other available host. While the majority of mosquito blood meals in our sample were derived from P. bivittatus, only one was derived from S. merianae. These results demonstrate that local mosquitoes will feed on invasive P. bivittatus, a recently introduced host. If these interactions also occur in southern Florida, P. bivittatus may be involved in the transmission networks of mosquito-vectored pathogens. Our results also illustrate the potential of detecting the presence of P. bivittatus in the field through screening mosquito blood meals for their DNA.},

The beetle can cause great economic losses, not only to agriculture but also due to indirect impacts on tropical aesthetics and tourism. In the last decade, new invasive populations of the beetle have been detected on Guam and Oahu, Hawaii. Despite the beetle’s extensive invasion history and economic impacts, little is known about its invasion dynamics. We used 1,480 base pairs of cytochrome oxidase subunit I mitochondrial and 814 base pairs of carbamoyl-phosphate synthetase, aspartate transcarbamoylase, dihydroorotase nuclear DNA to conduct a population genetics analysis on eight beetle populations from Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, and China in the beetle’s native range and Palau, American Samoa, Guam, and Hawaii in the beetle’s invasive range, in an attempt to resolve invasion pathways. Genetic diversity was insufficient to generate strong evidence for O. rhinoceros movement patterns. Mitochondrial DNA provided a clear but poorly supported population structure. Although nuclear DNA proved to be more diverse, population structure lacked clear signal. This lack of diversity is congruent with a rapid, recent invasion. There appears to be no genetic exchange between populations once they establish, implying that they are rare, human-mediated dispersal events.},

  abstract = {Abstract Biological control agents have several advantages over chemical control for pest management, including the capability to restore ecosystem balance with minimal non-target effects and a lower propensity for targets to develop resistance. These factors are particularly important for invasive species control. The coconut rhinoceros beetle (Oryctes rhinoceros Linnaeus) is a major palm pest that invaded many Pacific islands in the early 20th century through human-mediated dispersal. Application of the Oryctes nudivirus in the 1960s successfully halted the beetle's first invasion wave and made it a textbook example of successful biological control. However, a recently discovered O.~rhinoceros biotype that is resistant to the nudivirus appears to be correlated with a new invasion wave. We performed a population genomics analysis of 172 O.~rhinoceros from seven regions, including native and invasive populations, to reconstruct invasion pathways and explore correlation between recent invasions and biotypes. With ddRAD sequencing, we generated data sets ranging from 4,000 to 209,000 loci using stacks and ipyrad software pipelines and compared genetic signal in downstream clustering and phylogenetic analyses. Analysis suggests that the O.~rhinoceros resurgence is mediated by the nudivirus-resistant biotype. Genomic data have been proven essential to understanding the new O.~rhinoceros biotype's invasion patterns and interactions with the original biotype. Such information is crucial to optimization of strategies for quarantine and control of resurgent pests. Our results demonstrate that while invasions are relatively rare events, new introductions can have significant ecological consequences, and quarantine vigilance is required even in previously invaded areas.},

The fact that these are not open, findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable (FAIR) severely hampers fast and efficient information flow to policy and decision-making that are required to tackle the current biodiversity crisis. Here, we propose a reproducible, semi-automated workflow to transform traditional checklist data into a FAIR and open species registry. We showcase our workflow by applying it to the publication of the Manual of Alien Plants, a species checklist specifically developed for the Tracking Invasive Alien Species (TrIAS) project. Our approach combines source data management, reproducible data transformation to Darwin Core using R, version control, data documentation and publication to the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF). This checklist publication workflow is openly available for data holders and applicable to species registries varying in thematic, taxonomic or geographical scope and could serve as an important tool to open up research and strengthen environmental decision-making.},

We discuss the different sources of vibrations that can be picked up from trees in urban environments and how deep learning methods can focus on those originating from borers.

We aim at introducing permanent, cost-effective, automatic monitoring of trees based on deep learning techniques, in commodity entry point as well as in wild, urban and cultivated areas in order to effect large-scale, sustainable pest-risk analysis and management of wood boring insects such as those from the Cerambycidae family (longhorn beetles).},

The larval ecology of the two species is very similar; both species breed in tree holes, coconut shells, and other natural and man-made water containers. The purpose of the study was to compare the relative densities of larval populations of the two species with those determined in a survey made in 1948-49. The results suggest that as the population density of A. albopictus increased, that of A. guamensis decreased by as much as about 95\% in artificial containers, and by 30\% or more in natural breeding habitats. Since there seems to be no environmental factor involved in rendering the breeding places unsuitable for A. guamensis, the reduction in A. guamensis populations may be, in part, the result of competition from A. albopictus.},

We conducted both targeted surveys and grid transect searches on Guam and targeted surveys across the islands of Saipan, Tinian and Rota to locate native hostplants, eggs, caterpillars and adults of these rare insects. Despite having a relatively common hostplant, V. egistina was not found during this study, even in places it had last been found. Although various life stages of H. o. marianensis were documented, the hostplants of this species were heavily impacted by grazing of introduced ungulates; only in native limestone forest with jagged tower karst topography, did hostplants persist, and the butterfly with them. The reasons for the disappearance of V. egistina are not clear, but do not appear to be related to hostplant availability. Our surveys suggest that control of invasive ungulates on Guam will be the single most effective conservation action for Mariana eight-spot recovery, and is essential to any chance of long-term persistence for the species there. H. o. marianensis has significant, unoccupied, hostplant patches on the three northern islands (Rota, Tinian, and Saipan) which might be considered as sites for future translocation and reintroduction efforts, in order to reduce the risk of extinction.},

  abstract = {Biodiversity of insects is threatened worldwide. Here, we present a comprehensive review of 73 historical reports of insect declines from across the globe, and systematically assess the underlying drivers. Our work reveals dramatic rates of decline that may lead to the extinction of 40\% of the world's insect species over the next few decades. In terrestrial ecosystems, Lepidoptera, Hymenoptera and dung beetles (Coleoptera) appear to be the taxa most affected, whereas four major aquatic taxa (Odonata, Plecoptera, Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera) have already lost a considerable proportion of species. Affected insect groups not only include specialists that occupy particular ecological niches, but also many common and generalist species. Concurrently, the abundance of a small number of species is increasing; these are all adaptable, generalist species that are occupying the vacant niches left by the ones declining. Among aquatic insects, habitat and dietary generalists, and pollutant-tolerant species are replacing the large biodiversity losses experienced in waters within agricultural and urban settings. The main drivers of species declines appear to be in order of importance: i) habitat loss and conversion to intensive agriculture and urbanisation; ii) pollution, mainly that by synthetic pesticides and fertilisers; iii) biological factors, including pathogens and introduced species; and iv) climate change. The latter factor is particularly important in tropical regions, but only affects a minority of species in colder climes and mountain settings of temperate zones. A rethinking of current agricultural practices, in particular a serious reduction in pesticide usage and its substitution with more sustainable, ecologically-based practices, is urgently needed to slow or reverse current trends, allow the recovery of declining insect populations and safeguard the vital ecosystem services they provide. In addition, effective remediation technologies should be applied to clean polluted waters in both agricultural and urban environments.},

  abstract = {Migrating eastern North American monarch butterflies use a time-compensated sun compass to adjust their flight to the southwest direction. Although the antennal genetic circadian clock and the azimuth of the sun are instrumental for proper function of the compass, it is unclear how these signals are represented on a neuronal level and how they are integrated to produce flight control. To address these questions, we constructed a receptive field model of the compound eye that encodes the solar azimuth. We then derived a neural circuit model that integrates azimuthal and circadian signals to correct flight direction. The model demonstrates an integration mechanism, which produces robust trajectories reaching the southwest regardless of the time of day and includes a configuration for remigration. Comparison of model simulations with flight trajectories of butterflies in a flight simulator shows analogous behaviors and affirms the prediction that midday is the optimal time for migratory flight.},

More than 7400 live and dead insects were collected from 1174 containers. No live infestations of timber-feeding insects were recorded, but feeding damage detected in one floor indicates a low risk of importing colonies of timber pests in containers. The survey collection of dead insects demonstrates that containers are regularly exposed to economically important quarantinable insects, including timber pests (bostrichids, curculionids, cerambycids, siricids and termites), agricultural pests (including Adoretus sinicus, Adoretus sp., Carpophilus obsoletus and Philaenus spumarius), and nuisance pests (vespids and Solenopsis sp.). Stored product pests were found in more than 10\% of containers. The assessment of pest risk associated with shipping containers is discussed in terms of the quantity and quality of opportunities for exotic insects to establish via this pathway.},

Best practices and workflows for digitization, transcription, extraction, and integration with other sources are nascent or non-existent. In this paper, we demonstrate a workflow to generate structured outputs while also maintaining links to the original texts. The first step in this workflow was to place already digitized and transcribed field notebooks from the University of Colorado Museum of Natural History founder, Junius Henderson, on Wikisource, an open text transcription platform. Next, we created Wikisource templates to document places, dates, and taxa to facilitate annotation and wiki-linking. We then requested help from the public, through social media tools, to take advantage of volunteer efforts and energy. After three notebooks were fully annotated, content was converted into XML and annotations were extracted and cross-walked into Darwin Core compliant record sets. Finally, these recordsets were vetted, to provide valid taxon names, via a process we call “taxonomic referencing.” The result is identification and mobilization of 1,068 observations from three of Henderson’s thirteen notebooks and a publishable Darwin Core record set for use in other analyses. Although challenges remain, this work demonstrates a feasible approach to unlock observations from field notebooks that enhances their discovery and interoperability without losing the narrative context from which those observations are drawn., “Compose your notes as if you were writing a letter to someone a century in the future.”,},

Finally, these recordsets were vetted, to provide valid taxon names, via a process we call “taxonomic referencing.” The result is identification and mobilization of 1,068 observations from three of Henderson’s thirteen notebooks and a publishable Darwin Core record set for use in other analyses. Although challenges remain, this work demonstrates a feasible approach to unlock observations from field notebooks that enhances their discovery and interoperability without losing the narrative context from which those observations are drawn. “Compose your notes as if you were writing a letter to someone a century in the future.” Perrine and Patton (2011)},

  title = {Conservation {{Evidence Monitoring}} of Ecosystem Function at Landscape ‐scale Demonstrates Temporal Difference in Invertebrate Abundance in {{Kent}} and {{South}}‐{{East England}}},
  author = {Tinsley, Paul and Skilbeck, Alana and Riggs, Alison},
  date = {2021},
  pages = {4},
  abstract = {A growing body of recent evidence1 highlights population declines in insects and other invertebrates at global scales, the consequences of which are potentially catastrophic. Invertebrates are a critical component of ecosystem function, and all functional groups (herbivores, detritivores, parasitoids, predators and pollinators) are at risk. Without them life on earth would collapse.  Considerable conservation effort is targeted at invertebrates. The focus of delivery of conservation action has shifted from site to landscape‐scale, and practitioners seek to evidence landscape‐scale outcomes of conservation action. Here we use an innovative invertebrate sampling technique conducted by citizen scientists to assess the difference in invertebrate abundance in the south‐east of England over a 15 year timeframe.  The windscreen phenomenon2 is a term given to the anecdotal observation that people tend to find fewer insects squashed on the windscreens of their cars now, compared to a decade or several decades ago. This effect has been ascribed to major global declines in insect abundance. Using a standardised sampling grid termed a ‘splatometer’, members of the public were asked to record the number of insects and other invertebrates squashed on the number plate of their car, having first cleaned the number plate before commencing a journey.  A national survey using this methoodology led by the RSPB took place in 2004, and by repeating the survey in Kent in 2019 we were able to compare the abundance of invertebrates between these points in time. Between 2004 (n=3838) and 2019 (n=667) there was a statistically significant difference in ‘splat density’ of the order of approximately 50\%, from an average of 0.2 splats per mile to 0.1 splats per mile (Figures 1 \& 3a). This differerence mirrors the patterns of decline widely reported by others3,4. It should be noted that this observation is based on data from two points in time. Consequntly it does not constitute a trend and cannot be interpreted as a decline. Inter‐annual variation in variables such as weather cannot be ruled out as factors influencing the observed pattern. More data over a number of years will be required to confirm the direction of any trend, however the observed pattern corrlates with examples of decline.  We addressed two limitations of the 2004 survey. Firstly, in 2004 participants were not provided guidance on journey length, and a large number of long journeys spanning several counties resulted in the data providing poor spatial resolution of variation. Only variation between regions was resolved in the 2004 data, but by encouraging participants to submit data from both short and long journeys, we were able to map spatial variation in splat density within Kent (Figure 2).  The second limitation we addressed concerned a criticism levelled at the methodology in terms of the effect of vehicle design on the rate of invertebrate sampling. Modern cars are more areodynamically designed than in the past, and changes over time may affect the numbers of insects getting squashed. We actively recruited classic car owners to take part in the survey, allowing us to collect data using cars ranging in age from 1957 to 2018. We found a small but statistically significant positive relationship between vehicle age and splat density, suggesting that modern cars squash more invertebrates that older cars (Figure 3b). This suggests that the signal from the difference in insect abundance is strong enough to be apparent inspite of more efficient sampling by newer vehicles.  This study has the potential to add to the growing body of evidence for significant invertebrate declines in the UK, highlighting a significant effect in Kent and the south‐east of the UK, and supports the case for conservation policy and practice to reverse declines and restore invertebrate populations.},

To enable more effective management of alien species, we reviewed, collated and analysed all available records of alien species for Galápagos. We also assembled a comprehensive dataset on pathways to and among the Galápagos Islands, including tourist and resident numbers, tourist vessels, their itineraries and visitation sites, aircraft capacity and occupancy, air and sea cargo and biosecurity interceptions. So far, 1,579 alien terrestrial and marine species have been introduced to Galápagos by humans. Of these, 1,476 have become established. Almost half of these were intentional introductions, mostly of plants. Most unintentional introductions arrived on plants and plant associated material, followed by transport vehicles, and commodities (in particular fruit and vegetables). The number, frequency and geographic origin of pathways for the arrival and dispersal of alien species to and within Galápagos have increased over time, tracking closely the increase in human population (residents and tourists) on the islands. Intentional introductions of alien species should decline as biosecurity is strengthened but there is a danger that unintentional introductions will increase further as tourism on Galápagos expands. This unique world heritage site will only retain its biodiversity values if the pathways for invasion are managed effectively.},

Sound recordings offer ecologists the potential advantages of cheaper and increased sampling. An acoustic event detection algorithm is introduced that outputs a compact rectangular marquee description of each event. It can disentangle superimposed events, which are a common occurrence during morning and evening choruses. Next, three uses to which acoustic event detection can be put are illustrated. These tasks have been selected because they illustrate quite different modes of analysis: (1) the detection of diffuse events caused by wind and rain, which are a frequent contaminant of recordings of the terrestrial environment; (2) the detection of bird calls using the spatial distribution of their component events; and (3) the preparation of acoustic maps for whole ecosystem analysis. This last task utilises the temporal distribution of events over a daily, monthly or yearly cycle.},

  abstract = {Connecting basic data about bats and other potential mammal hosts of SARS-CoV-2 with their ecological context is now critical for understanding the emergence and spread of COVID-19. However, when global lockdown started in March 2020, the world’s bat experts were locked out of their research laboratories, which, in turn, locked up large volumes of offline ecological and taxonomic data. Global lockdown has put a magnifying glass on the long-standing problem of biological ‘dark data’ that is published but disconnected from digital knowledge resources, and thus unavailable for high-throughput analysis. Host-to-virus knowledge will be biased until this challenge is addressed. Here we outline two viable solutions: (i) how to interconnect published data about mammal hosts and viruses in the short term; and (ii) how to shift the publishing paradigm beyond unstructured text (e.g., PDFs) to labeled networks of digital knowledge. Biological taxonomy is foundational to both solutions as the indexing system for biodiversity data. Building digitally connected ‘knowledge graphs’ of host-virus interactions will establish the needed agility for quickly identifying reservoir hosts of novel zoonoses, allow for AI-based predictions of emergence, and thereby improve planetary health security.},

However, previous studies that combined entomological lidar and machine learning for insect classification tasks have all been performed under controlled laboratory conditions. In this study, we compared several machine learning algorithms' ability to detect insects in field data with a high class imbalance of 7667:1. Using a single-hidden-layer neural network, we detected 61.19\% of the insects, and were able to discard 98.25\% of the testing data. Compared to state-of-the-art field studies where researchers manually detect insects, our results are a significant step towards automated insect detection and classification in field experiments.},

Nests of paper wasps were collected from urban residential and salt marsh habitats, larvae were removed and dissected, and DNA in the gut of the paper wasp larvae was amplified and sequenced with cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI). Seventy percent of samples (211/299) yielded medium-to high-quality sequences, and prey identification was achieved using BLAST searches in BOLD. A total of 42 taxa were identified from 211 samples. Lepidoptera were the majority of prey, with 39 taxa from 91\% of samples. Diptera was a relatively small component of prey (three taxa, 19 samples). Conclusive species-level identification of prey was possible for 67\% of samples, and genus-level identification, for another 12\% of samples. The composition of prey taken was different between the two habitats, with 2.5× more native prey species being taken in salt marsh compared with urban habitats. The results greatly extend the prey range of this invasive species. The technique is a more effective and efficient approach than relying on the collection of “prey balls”, or morphological identification of prey, for the study of paper wasps.},

CRB is a major pest of coconut palm trees (Cocos nucifera) in its expanded range which includes tropical islands in the Pacific, and  most recently the island of Oahu in the Hawaiian archipelago. For decades a double-stranded DNA virus, Oryctes rhinoceros nudivirus (OrNV; family  Nudiviridae, genus Alphanudivirus), has been an effective biological control agent reducing the impact of CRB in its native and expanded range. CRB  arrived  in  Oahu  in  2013  and  an  intensive  eradication  effort  is  currently  underway.  The  purpose  of  this  study  is to  determine  whether  OrNV  is  present in Oahu’s incipient CRB population, as its presence may positively impact eradication efforts. To date, 21 field-caught CRB specimens have  been assayed for OrNV using a PCR-based assay, all of which have been determined to be negative for the virus. This suggests that OrNV did not  accompany CRB during its invasion of Oahu, and/or CRB on Oahu are resistant to the virus. We also assayed CRB specimens from several locations  in Southeast Asia and Pacific Islands for the presence of OrNV and examined the genetic diversity of the virus within a 945 bp region of the gene  coding  for  the  gp83-like  protein. OrNV  could  be  found  in  all  locations  from  which  specimens  were  collected,  with  the  island  of Guam  being  an  exception. Sequence analyses of OrNV isolates indicate low genetic diversity, which may limit the genotypes of CRB this virus may be able to infect.},

To better under its reproductive biology and to find a specific, effective, and low-impact control method for this species, we identified and tested the key compounds in V. velutina sex pheromone. Virgin gynes (reproductive females) produced this sex pheromone in the sixth intersegmental sternal glands of their abdomens. The active compounds were 4-oxo-octanoic acid (4-OOA, 10.4\,μg bee−1) and 4-oxo-decanoic acid (4-ODA, 13.3\,μg bee−1) at a 0.78 ratio of 4-OOA/4-ODA. We synthesized these compounds and showed that male antennae were highly sensitive to them. Moreover, males were only strongly attracted to a 4-OOA/4-ODA blend at the natural ratio produced by gynes. These results provide the first demonstration of an effective way to lure V. velutina males, and the first chemical identification of a sex pheromone in the eusocial hornets.},

Despite the elaborate literature on mechanisms, robust data on costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones are scant. Existing literature indicates that, in contrast to the diversity of mechanisms, the ecological conditions in which aggregation pheromones are used are more alike. This points to a few general categories for costs and benefits of aggregation pheromones, and these are discussed. We subsequently review interspecific interactions that may be affected by the use of aggregation pheromones. We encounter a strikingly frequent association of aggregation pheromones with fungi and microorganisms and address cross-attraction by competitor species and exploitation by natural enemies. We show that aggregative behavior by individuals through the use of pheromones can profoundly affect ecological interactions and advocate further evolutionary and ecological investigations of pheromone-mediated aggregation.},

  abstract = {In the Pacific region, the African big-headed ant, Pheidole megacephala, is now widespread in tropical areas; populations are also found at higher latitudes in Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. On most inhabited tropical islands in the Pacific, P. megacephala is well known as a household and agricultural pest. Because P. megacephala does not attack humans, this species is often not recognized as an important threat. The negative ecological impact of P. megacephala, however, may be greater than that of any other invasive ant species. In areas where it occurs at high density, few native invertebrates persist. Loss of invertebrate species that serve key functions in the natural community (e.g., important prey species) may have cascading effects leading to the subsequent loss of additional species. Pheidole megacephala tends to thrive in open, disturbed habitats with weedy vegetation that can support high densities of plant-feeding Hemiptera, which these ants tend for honeydew. Before 1900, P. megacephala was known in the Pacific region only from Aru Island (Indonesia) and Hawai‘i. By the 1930s, it was found through much of Pacific Asia, Melanesia, and Polynesia, but it was not collected in Micronesia until 1950. Currently P. megacephala is known from virtually every tropical island group in the Pacific but not from many islands within the groups, particularly uninhabited islands. Quarantine efforts might be successful in keeping P. megacephala off these islands. Because P. megacephala does not commonly dominate areas with intact natural vegetation, setting aside relatively undisturbed habitat on inhabited islands may also be effective in protecting native invertebrates from attack by this ant.},

Quantifying the influx of nonindigenous plant pest species through foreign trade is required for national and international risk assessments, monitoring and conservation efforts, and evaluation of ecological factors that affect invasion success. Here we use statistically robust data collected at US ports of entry and border crossings to estimate arrival rates of nonindigenous insect species via four cargo pathways and to evaluate the effectiveness of current efforts to monitor arrival of nonindigenous insect species. Interception rates were highest in refrigerated maritime cargo where a new insect species was intercepted on average every 54 inspections. Projected estimates of insect species richness stabilized only for non-refrigerated maritime cargo and US–Mexico border cargo, where inspectors likely detected 19–2\% and 30–50\% of the species being transported through these respective pathways. Conservative estimates of establishment suggest that 42 insect species may have become established through these four pathways between 1997 and 2001.},

  abstract = {Invertebrate biodiversity remains poorly explored although it comprises much of the terrestrial animal biomass, more than 90\% of the species-level diversity, supplies many ecosystem services. Increasing anthropogenic threads also require regular monitoring of invertebrate communities. The main obstacle is specimen- and species-rich samples consisting of thousands of small specimens. Traditional sorting techniques require manual handling based on morphology and are too slow and labor-intensive. Molecular techniques based on metabarcoding struggle with obtaining reliable abundance information. We here present a fully automated sorting robot for small specimens that are detected in the mixed sample using a convolutional neural network. Each specimen is then moved from the mixed sample to a well of a 96-well microplate in preparation for DNA barcoding. Prior to movement, the specimen is being photographed and assigned to 14 particularly common “classes” of insects in Malaise trap samples. The average assignment precision for the classes is 91.4 \% (75-100 \%) based on a preliminary neural network that is expected to improve further as more images are used for training. In order to obtain biomass information, the specimen images are also used to measure the specimen length and estimate the body volume. We outline how the “DiversityScanner” robot can be a key component for tackling and monitoring invertebrate diversity by generating large numbers of images that become training sets for species-, genus-, or family-level convolutional neural networks, once the imaged specimens are classified with DNA barcodes. The robot also allows for taxon-specific subsampling of large invertebrate samples. We conclude that the combination of automation, machine learning, and DNA barcoding has the potential to tackle invertebrate diversity at an unprecedented scale.},

  abstract = {Oryctes rhinoceros (L.) breeding and survival in decaying coconut wood was studied in 53 plots (each 9 ha) in southern Luzon, Philippines. Compared with stumps and coconut trunks on the ground, dead standing palms were preferred for breeding and contained baculovirus-infected larvae 5- to 15-fold more frequently. The percentage of baculovirus-infected breeding sites increased with density of dead standing palms up to about five dead palms per hectare, but then decreased again. Larva mortality was higher in dead standing palms and stumps than in trunks on the ground. Rainfall was also a significant mortality factor. Palm damage due to O. rhinoceros increased with density of stumps and trunks on the ground but not with density of dead standing palms. It is concluded that in the Philippines dead standing palms can play an important role in spread of baculovirus and regulation of O. rhinoceros populations.},
